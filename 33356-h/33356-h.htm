ALFRED E. FLETCHER</p>
<h2><!-- page vii--><a name="pagevii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vii</span>FOREWORD</h2>
<p>In the introductory paper to this volume an attempt is made to
justify the epithet &ldquo;Vagabond&rdquo; as applied to writers
of a certain temperament.&nbsp; This much may be said here: the
term Vagabond is used in no derogatory sense.&nbsp;
Etymologically it signifies a wanderer; and such is the meaning
attached to the term in the following pages.&nbsp; Differing
frequently in character and in intellectual power, a basic
similarity of temperament gives the various writers discussed a
remarkable spiritual affinity.&nbsp; For in each one the
wandering instinct is strong.&nbsp; Sometimes it may take a
physical, sometimes an intellectual expression&mdash;sometimes
both.&nbsp; But always it shows itself, and always it is opposed
to the routine and conventions of ordinary life.</p>
<p>These papers are primarily studies in temperament; and the
literary aspects have been subordinated to the personal
element.&nbsp; In fact, they are studies of certain forces in
modern literature, viewed from a special standpoint.&nbsp; And
the standpoint adopted may, it is hoped, prove suggestive, though
it does not pretend to be exhaustive.</p>
<p>If the papers on Hazlitt and De Quincey are more fragmentary
than the others, it is because these writers have been already
discussed by the author in a previous volume.&nbsp; It has been
thought unnecessary to repeat the points raised there, and these
studies may be regarded therefore as at once supplementary and
complementary.</p>
<p><!-- page viii--><a name="pageviii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. viii</span>My cordial thanks are due to Mr.
Theodore Watts-Dunton, who has taken so kindly and friendly an
interest in this little volume.&nbsp; He was good enough to read
the proofs, and to express his appreciation, especially of the
Borrow and Thoreau articles, in most generous terms.&nbsp; I had
hoped, indeed, that he would have honoured these slight studies
by a prefatory note, and he had expressed a wish to do so.&nbsp;
Unhappily, prior claims upon his time prevented this.&nbsp; The
book deals largely, it will be seen, with those &ldquo;Children
of the Open Air&rdquo; about whom the eloquent author of
<i>Aylwin</i> so often has written.&nbsp; I am especially glad,
therefore, to quote (with Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s permission)
his fine sonnet, where the &ldquo;Vagabond&rdquo; spirit in its
happiest manifestation is expressed.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;A TALK ON
WATERLOO BRIDGE<br />
<span class="smcap">&ldquo;the last sight of george
borrow</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;We talked of &lsquo;Children of the Open Air,&rsquo;<br
/>
Who once on hill and valley lived aloof,<br />
Loving the sun, the wind, the sweet reproof<br />
Of storms, and all that makes the fair earth fair,<br />
Till, on a day, across the mystic bar<br />
Of moonrise, came the &lsquo;Children of the Roof,&rsquo;<br />
Who find no balm &rsquo;neath evening&rsquo;s rosiest woof,<br />
Nor dews of peace beneath the Morning Star.<br />
We looked o&rsquo;er London, where men wither and choke,<br />
Roofed in, poor souls, renouncing stars and skies,<br />
And lore of woods and wild wind prophecies,<br />
Yea, every voice that to their fathers spoke:<br />
And sweet it seemed to die ere bricks and smoke<br />
Leave never a meadow outside Paradise.&rdquo; <a

<p>There are some men born with a vagrant strain in the blood, an
unsatiable inquisitiveness about the world beyond their
doors.&nbsp; Natural revolutionaries they, with an ingrained
distaste for the routine of ordinary life and the conventions of
civilization.&nbsp; The average common-sense Englishman distrusts
the Vagabond for his want of sympathy with established law and
order.&nbsp; Eccentricity and unconventionality smack to him
always of moral obliquity.&nbsp; And thus it is that the literary
Vagabond is looked at askance.&nbsp; One is reminded of Mr.
Pecksniff: &ldquo;Pagan, I regret to state,&rdquo; observed that
gentleman of the Sirens on one occasion.&nbsp; Unhappily no one
pointed out to this apostle of purity that the naughtiness of the
Sirens was not necessarily connected with paganism, and that the
siren disposition has been found even &ldquo;in choirs and places
where they sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Restlessness, then, is one of the notes of the Vagabond
temperament.</p>
<p>Sometimes the Vagabond is a physical, sometimes only an
intellectual wanderer; but in any case there is <!-- page 4--><a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>about him
something of the primal wildness of the woods and hills.</p>
<p>Thus it is we find in the same spiritual brotherhood men so
different in genius and character as Hazlitt, De Quincey,
Thoreau, Whitman, Borrow, Jefferies, Stevenson.</p>
<p>Thoreau turned his back on civilization, and found a new joy
of living in the woods at Maine.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the Open Road
that inspired Whitman with his rude, melodic chants.&nbsp; Not
the ways of men and women, but the flaunting &ldquo;pageant of
summer&rdquo; unlocked the floodgates of Jefferies&rsquo;
heart.&nbsp; Hazlitt was never so gay, never wrote of books with
such relish, as when he was recounting a country walk.&nbsp;
There are few more beautiful passages than those where he
describes the time when he walked between Wrexham and Llangollen,
his imagination aglow with some lines of Coleridge.&nbsp; De
Quincey loved the shiftless, nomadic life, and gloried in
uncertainties and peradventures.&nbsp; A wandering, open-air life
was absolutely indispensable to Borrow&rsquo;s happiness; and
Stevenson had a schoolboy&rsquo;s delight in the make-believe of
Romance.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Another note now discovers itself&mdash;a passion for the
Earth.&nbsp; All these men had a passion for the Earth, an
intense joy in the open air.&nbsp; This feeling differs from the
Nature-worship of poets like Wordsworth and Shelly.&nbsp; It is
less romantic, more realistic.&nbsp; The attitude is not so much
that of the devotee as that of the lover.&nbsp; There <!-- page
5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>is
nothing mystical or abstract about it.&nbsp; It is direct,
personal, intimate.&nbsp; I call it purposely a passion for the
Earth rather than a passion for Nature, in order to distinguish
it from the pronounced transcendentalism of the romantic
poets.</p>
<p>The poet who has expressed most nearly the attitude of these
Vagabonds towards Nature&mdash;more particularly that of Thoreau,
Whitman, Borrow, and Jefferies&mdash;is Mr. George Meredith.</p>
<p>Traces of it may be found in Browning with reference to the
&ldquo;old brown earth,&rdquo; and in William Morris, who
exclaimed&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My love of the earth and the worship of
it!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but Mr. Meredith has given the completest expression to this
Earth-worship.</p>
<p>One thinks of Thoreau and Jefferies when reading
Melampus&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With love exceeding a simple love of the
things<br />
That glide in grasses and rubble of woody wreck;<br />
Or change their perch on a beat of quivering wings<br />
From branch to branch, only restful to pipe and peck;<br />
Or, bristled, curl at a touch their snouts in a ball;<br />
Or, cast their web between bramble and thorny hook;<br />
The good physician Melampus, loving them all,<br />
Among them walked, as a scholar who reads a book.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While that ripe oddity, &ldquo;Juggling Jerry,&rdquo; would
have delighted the &ldquo;Romany&rdquo;-loving Borrow.</p>
<p>Indeed the Nature philosophy of Mr. Meredith, with its virile
joy in the rich plenitude of Nature and its touch of wildness has
more in common with Thoreau, with Jefferies, with Borrow, and
with Whitman than with <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, or
even with Tennyson&mdash;the first of our poets to look upon the
Earth with the eyes of the scientist.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>But a passion for the Earth is not sufficient of itself to
admit within the charmed circle of the Vagabond; for there is no
marked restlessness about Mr. Meredith&rsquo;s genius, and he
lacks what it seems to me is the third note of the genuine
literary Vagabond&mdash;the note of aloofness, of personal
detachment.&nbsp; This it is which separates the Vagabond from
the generality of his fellows.&nbsp; No very prolonged scrutiny
of the disposition of Thoreau, Jefferies, and Borrow is needed to
reveal a pronounced shyness and reserve.&nbsp; Examine this trait
more closely, and it will exhibit a certain emotional coldness
towards the majority of men and women.&nbsp; No one can overlook
the chill austerity that marks Thoreau&rsquo;s attitude in social
converse.&nbsp; Borrow, again, was inaccessible to a degree, save
to one or two intimates; even when discovered among congenial
company, with the gipsies or with companions of the road like
Isopel Berners, exhibiting, to me, a genial bleakness that is
occasionally exasperating.</p>
<p>It was his constitutional reserve that militated against the
success of Jefferies as a writer.&nbsp; He was not easy to get on
with, not over fond of his kind, and rarely seems quite at ease
save in the solitude of the fields.</p>
<p>Whitman seems at first sight an exception.&nbsp; Surely here
was a friendly man if ever there was one.&nbsp; Yet an <!-- page
7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>examination of his life and writings will compel us to
realize a lack of deep personal feeling in the man.&nbsp; He
loves the People rather than the people.&nbsp; Anyone who will go
along with him is a welcome comrade.&nbsp; This catholic spirit
of friendliness is delightful and attractive in many ways, but it
has its drawbacks; it is not possible perhaps to have both
extensity and intensity of emotion.&nbsp; There is the impartial
friendliness of the wind and sun about his salutations.&nbsp; He
loves all men&mdash;because they are a part of Nature; but it is
the common human element in men and women themselves that
attracts him.&nbsp; There was less of the Ishmaelite about
Whitman than about Thoreau, Borrow, or Jefferies; but the man
whose company he really delighted in was the &ldquo;powerful,
uneducated man&rdquo;&mdash;the artisan and the mechanic.&nbsp;
Those he loved best were those who had something of the elemental
in their natures&mdash;those who lived nearest to the
earth.&nbsp; Without denying for a moment that Whitman was
capable of genuine affection, I cannot help feeling, from the
impression left upon me by his writings, and by accounts given by
those who knew him, that what I must call an absence of human
<i>passion</i>&mdash;not necessarily affection&mdash;which seems
to characterize more or less the Vagabond generally, may be
detected in Whitman, no less than in Thoreau and Borrow.&nbsp; It
would seem that the passion for the earth, which made
them&mdash;to use one of Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s happy
phrases&mdash;&ldquo;Children of the Open Air,&rdquo; took the
place of a passion for human kind.</p>
<p>In the papers dealing with these writers these points are
discussed at greater length.&nbsp; For the present <!-- page
8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>reference is made to them in order to illustrate the
characteristics of the Vagabond temperament, and to vindicate my
generic title.</p>
<p>The characteristics, then, which I find in the Vagabond
temperament are (1) Restlessness&mdash;the wandering instinct;
this expresses itself mentally as well as physically.&nbsp; (2) A
passion for the Earth&mdash;shown not only in the love of the
open air, but in a delight in all manifestations of life.&nbsp;
(3) A constitutional reserve whereby the Vagabond, though
rejoicing in the company of a few kindred souls, is put out of
touch with the majority of men and women.&nbsp; This is a
temperamental idiosyncrasy, and must not be confounded with
misanthropy.</p>
<p>These characteristics are not found in equal degree among the
writers treated of in these pages.&nbsp; Sometimes one
predominates, sometimes another.&nbsp; That is to be
expected.&nbsp; But to some extent all these characteristics
prevail.</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>There is a certain type of Vagabondage which may be covered by
the term &ldquo;Bohemianism.&rdquo;&nbsp; But &rsquo;tis of a
superficial character mostly, and is in the nature of a town-made
imitation.&nbsp; Graces and picturesqueness it may have of a
kind, but it lacks the rough virility, the sturdy grit, which is
the most attractive quality of the best Vagabond.</p>
<p>Bohemianism indeed is largely an attitude of dress;
Vagabondage an attitude of spirit.&nbsp; At heart the Bohemian is
not really unconventional; he is not nomadic by instinct as is
the Vagabond.</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>Take the case of Charles Lamb.&nbsp; There was a man
whose habits of life were pleasantly Bohemian, and whose sympathy
with the Vagabond temperament has made some critics over-hastily
class him temperamentally with writers like Hazlitt and De
Quincey.&nbsp; He was not a true Vagabond at all.&nbsp; He was a
Bohemian of the finer order, and his graces of character need no
encomium to-day.&nbsp; But he was certainly not a Vagabond.&nbsp;
At heart he was devoted to convention.&nbsp; When released from
his drudgery of clerkship he confessed frankly how potent an
influence routine had been and still was in his life.&nbsp; This
is not the tone of the Vagabond.&nbsp; Even Elia&rsquo;s
wanderings on paper are more apparent than real, and there is a
method in his quaintest fantasies.&nbsp; His discursive essays
are arabesques observing geometrical patterns, and though
seemingly careless, follow out cunningly preconceived
designs.&nbsp; He only appears to digress; but all his bypaths
lead back into the high road.&nbsp; Hazlitt, on the other hand,
was a genuine digressionalist; so was De Quincey; so was
Borrow.&nbsp; There is all the difference between their literary
mosaic and the arabesques of Lamb.&nbsp; And should one still
doubt how to classify Elia, one could scarcely place him among
the &ldquo;Children of the Open Air.&rdquo;&nbsp; Make what
allowance you like for his whimsical remarks about the country,
it is certain that no passion for the Earth possessed him.</p>
<p>One characteristic, however, both the Bohemian and the
Vagabond have in common&mdash;that is, restlessness.&nbsp; And
although there is a restlessness which is the outcome of
superabundant nervous energy&mdash;the restlessness <!-- page
10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>of
Dickens in his earlier years, for instance&mdash;yet it must be
regarded as, for the most part, a pathological sign.&nbsp; One of
the legacies of the Industrial Revolution has been the neurotic
strain which it has bequeathed to our countrymen.&nbsp; The
stress of life upon the nervous system in this era of
commercialism has produced a spirit of feverish unrest which,
permeating society generally, has visited a few souls with
special intensity.&nbsp; It has never been summed up better than
by Ruskin, when, in one of his scornful flashes, he declared that
our two objects in life were: whatever we have, to get more; and
wherever we are, to go somewhere else.&nbsp; Nervous instability
is very marked in the case of Hazlitt and De Quincey; and there
was a strain of morbidity in Borrow, Jefferies, and
Stevenson.</p>
<p>Far more pronounced in its neurotic character is Modern
Bohemianism&mdash;as I prefer to call the &ldquo;town
Vagabond.&rdquo;&nbsp; The decadent movement in literature has
produced many interesting artistic figures, but they lack the
grit and the sanity of outlook which undoubtedly marks the
Vagabond.&nbsp; In France to-day morbidity and Vagabondage are
inseparable.</p>
<p>Gallic Vagabonds, such as Verlaine and Baudelaire, interesting
as they are to men of letters and students of psychology, do not
engage our affections as do the English Vagabonds.&nbsp; We do
not take kindly to their personalities.&nbsp; It is like passing
through the hot streets after inhaling the scent of the
woodland.&nbsp; There is something stifling and unhealthy about
the atmosphere, and one turns with relief to the vagabondage of
men like Whitman, who are &ldquo;enamoured of growth out of
doors.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>Of profounder interest is the Russian Vagabond.&nbsp; In
Russian Literature the Vagabond seems to be the rule, not the
exception.</p>
<p>Every great Russian writer has more or less of the Vagabond
about him.&nbsp; Tolstoy, it is true, wears the robe of the
Moralist, and Tolstoy the Ascetic cries down Tolstoy the
Artist.&nbsp; But I always feel that the most enduring part of
Tolstoy&rsquo;s work is the work of the Vagabond temperament that
lurks beneath the stern preacher.&nbsp; Political and social
exigencies have driven him to take up a position which is
certainly not in harmony with many traits in his nature.</p>
<p>In the case of Gorky, of course, we have the Vagabond naked
and unashamed.&nbsp; His novels are fervent defences of the
Vagabond.&nbsp; What could be franker than this?&mdash;&ldquo;I
was born outside society, and for that reason I cannot take in a
strong dose of its culture, without soon feeling forced to get
outside it again, to wipe away the infinite complications, the
sickly refinements, of that kind of existence.&nbsp; I like
either to go about in the meanest streets of towns, because,
though everything there is dirty, it is all simple and sincere;
or else to wander about in the high roads and across the fields,
because that is always interesting; it refreshes one morally, and
needs no more than a pair of good legs to carry one.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Racial differences mark off in many ways the Russian Vagabond
from his English brother; a strange fatalism, a fierce
melancholy, and a nature of greater emotional intensity; but in
the passage quoted how much in common they have also.</p>
<h3><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>V</h3>
<p>There were literary Vagabonds in England before the nineteenth
century.&nbsp; Many interesting and picturesque
figures&mdash;Marlowe&rsquo;s, for instance&mdash;arrest the
attention of the student, and to some extent the characteristics
noted may be traced in these.&nbsp; But every century, no less
than every country, has its psychological atmosphere, and the
modern literary Vagabond is quite a distinctive individual.&nbsp;
Some I know are inclined to regard Goldsmith as one of the
Vagabond band; but, although a charming Vagabond in many ways, he
did not express his Vagabondage in his writings.&nbsp; The spirit
of his time was not conducive to Vagabond literature.&nbsp; The
spirit of the succeeding age especially favoured the Vagabond
strain.</p>
<p>The Gothic Revival, and the newly-awakened interest in
medievalism, warmed the imaginations of verse men and prose men
alike.&nbsp; The impulse to wander, to scale some &ldquo;peak in
Darien&rdquo; for the joy of a &ldquo;wild surmise,&rdquo; seized
every artist in letters&mdash;poet, novelist, essayist.&nbsp; A
longing for the mystic world, a passion for the unknown, surged
over men&rsquo;s minds with the same power and impetuosity as it
had done in the days of the Renaissance.&nbsp; Ordinary life had
grown uglier, more sordid; life seemed crushed in the thraldom of
mechanism.&nbsp; Men felt like schoolboys pent up in a narrow
whitewashed room who look out of the windows at the smiling and
alluring world beyond the gates.&nbsp; Small wonder that some who
hastened to escape should enter more <!-- page 13--><a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>thoroughly
than more cautious souls into the unconventional and the
changeful.</p>
<p>The swing of the pendulum was sure to come, and it is not
surprising that the mid-century furnishes fewer instances of
literary Vagabonds and of Vagabond moods.&nbsp; But with the
pre-Raphaelite Movement an impulse towards Vagabondage
revived.&nbsp; And the era which started with a De Quincey closed
with a Stevenson.</p>
<h3>VI</h3>
<p>Many writers who cannot be classed among the Vagabonds gave
occasional expression to the Vagabond moods which sweep across
every artist&rsquo;s soul at some time or other.&nbsp; It would
be beside my purpose to dwell at length upon these Vagabond
moods, for my chief concern is with the thorough-going
wanderer.&nbsp; Mention may be made in passing, however, of
Robert Browning, whose cordial detestation of Bohemianism is so
well known.&nbsp; Outwardly there was far less of the Vagabond
about him than about Tennyson.&nbsp; However the romantic spirit
may have touched his boyhood and youth, there looked little of it
in the staid, correctly dressed, middle-aged gentleman who
attended social functions and cheerfully followed the life
conventional.&nbsp; One recalls his disgust with George Sand and
her Bohemian circle, his hatred for spiritualism, his almost
Philistine horror of the shiftless and lawless elements in
life.&nbsp; At the same time I feel that Mr. Chesterton, in his
brilliant monograph of the poet, has overstated the case when he
says that &ldquo;neither all his liberality nor all his learning
<!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>ever made him anything but an Englishman of the middle
class.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had mixed blood in his veins, and the fact
that his grandmother was a Creole is not to be lightly brushed
aside by a Chestertonian paradox.&nbsp; For the Southern blood
shows itself from time to time in an unmistakable manner.&nbsp;
It is all very well to say that &ldquo;he carried the prejudices
of his class (i.e. the middle class) into eternity!&rdquo;&nbsp;
But we have to reckon with the hot passion of &ldquo;Time&rsquo;s
Revenges,&rdquo; the daring unconventionality of &ldquo;Fifine at
the Fair,&rdquo; and the rare sympathy and discernment of the
gipsy temperament in &ldquo;The Flight of the
Duchess.&rdquo;&nbsp; Conventional prejudices Browning
undoubtedly had, and there was a splendid level-headedness about
the man which kept in check the extravagances of Vagabondage.</p>
<p>But no poet who has studied men and women as he had studied
them, pondering with loving care the curious, the complex, the
eccentric, could have failed to break away at times from the
outlook of the middle-class Englishman.</p>
<p>Tennyson, on the other hand, looking the handsome Vagabond to
the life, living apart from the world, as if its conventions and
routine were distasteful to him, had scarcely a touch of the
Vagabond in his temperament.&nbsp; That he had no Vagabond moods
I will not say; for the poet who had no Vagabond moods has yet to
be born.&nbsp; But he frowned them down as best he could, and in
his writings we can see the typical, cultured, middle-class
Englishman as we certainly fail to see in Browning.&nbsp; A great
deal of Tennyson is merely Philistinism made musical.&nbsp; The
romantic temper scarcely touches him at <!-- page 15--><a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>all; and in
those noble poems&mdash;&ldquo;Lucretius,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ulysses,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tithonus&rdquo;&mdash;where his
special powers find their happiest expression, the attitude of
mind has nothing in common with that of the Vagabond.&nbsp; It
was classic art, not romantic art, that attracted Tennyson.</p>
<p>Compare the &ldquo;Guinevere&rdquo; of Tennyson with the
&ldquo;Guenevere&rdquo; of Morris, and you realize at once the
vast difference that separates Sentimentalism from
Romanticism.&nbsp; And Vagabondage can be approached only through
the gateway of Romanticism.</p>
<h3>VII</h3>
<p>In looking back upon these discursive comments on the Vagabond
element in modern literature, one cannot help asking what is the
resultant effect of the Vagabond temperament upon life and
thought.&nbsp; As psychologists no doubt we are content to
examine its peculiarities and extravagances without troubling to
ask how far it has made for sanity and sweetness.</p>
<p>Yet the question sooner or later rises to our lips.&nbsp; This
Vagabond temperament&mdash;is its charm and attractiveness merely
superficial?&nbsp; I cannot think so.&nbsp; I think that on the
whole its effect upon our literature has been salutary and
beneficial.</p>
<p>These more eager, more adventurous spirits express for us the
holiday mood of life.&nbsp; For they are young at heart, inasmuch
as they have lived in the sunshine, and breathed in the fresh,
untainted air.&nbsp; They have indeed scattered &ldquo;a new
roughness and gladness&rdquo; among men and women, for they have
spoken to us of the simple magic of the Earth.</p>

<h3><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>I</h3>
<p>It is not unusual to hear the epithet &ldquo;complex&rdquo;
flung with a too ready alacrity at any character who evinces
eccentricity of disposition.&nbsp; In olden days, when regularity
of conduct, and conformity even in small particulars were
regarded as moral essentials, the eccentric enjoyed short
shrift.&nbsp; The stake, the guillotine, or the dungeons of the
Inquisition speedily put an end to the eccentricities.&nbsp; A
slight measure of nonconformity was quite enough to earn the
appellation of witch or wizard.&nbsp; One stood no chance as an
eccentric unless the eccentricity was coupled with unusual force
of character.</p>
<p>Alienists assure us that insanity is on the increase, and it
is certain that modern conditions of life have favoured nervous
instabilities of temperament, which express themselves in
eccentricities of conduct.&nbsp; But nervous instability is one
thing, complexity another.&nbsp; The fact that they may co-exist
affords us no excuse for confusing them.&nbsp; We speak of a
man&rsquo;s personality, whereas it would be more correct to
speak of his personalities.</p>
<p>Much has been written of late years about multi-personalities,
until the impression has spread that the <!-- page 20--><a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>possession of
a number of differing personalities is a special form of
insanity.&nbsp; This is quite wrong.&nbsp; The sane, no less than
the insane man has a number of personalities, and the difference
between them lies in the power of co-ordination.&nbsp; The sane
man is like a skilful driver who is able to control his team of
horses; whereas the insane man has lost control of his steeds,
and allows first one and then the other to get the mastery of
him.</p>
<p>The personalities are no more numerous than before, only we
are made aware of their number.</p>
<p>In a sense, therefore, every human being is complex.&nbsp;
Inheritance and environment have left distinctive
characteristics, which, if the power of co-ordination be
weakened, take possession of the individual as opportunity may
determine.&nbsp; We usually apply the term personality to the
resulting blend of the various personalities in his nature.&nbsp;
In the case of sane men and women the personality is a very
composite affair.&nbsp; What we are thinking of frequently when
we apply the epithet &ldquo;complex&rdquo; is a certain
contradictoriness of temperament, the result of opposing strains
of blood.&nbsp; It is the quality, not the quantities, of the
personalities that affects us.&nbsp; If not altogether happy, the
expression may in these cases pass as a rough indication of the
opposing element in their nature.&nbsp; But when used, as it
often is, merely to indicate an eccentricity, the epithet assumes
a restricted significance.&nbsp; A may be far more complex than
B; but his power of co-ordination, what we call his will, is
strong, whereas that of B is weak, so we reserve the term complex
for the weaker individual.&nbsp; But why reserve the term complex
for a few literary decadents <!-- page 21--><a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>who have lost
the power of co-ordination, and not apply it to a mind like
Shakespeare&rsquo;s, who was certainly as complex a personality
as ever lived?</p>
<p>Now I do not deny that it is wrong to apply the term
complexity to men of unstable, nervous equilibrium.&nbsp; What I
do deny is the right to apply the term to these men only, thus
disseminating the fallacy&mdash;too popular nowadays&mdash;that
genius and insanity are inseparable.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, if we turn to Spencer&rsquo;s exposition
of the evolutionary doctrine we shall find an illustration ready
at hand to show that complexity is of two kinds.&nbsp; Evolution,
as he tells us, is a change from homogeneity to heterogeneity,
from a simple to a complex.&nbsp; Thus a dog is more complex than
a dog-fish, a man than a dog, a Shakespeare greater than a
Shaw.&nbsp; But complexity, though a law of Evolution, is not
<i>the</i> law of Evolution.&nbsp; Mere complexity is not
necessarily a sign of a higher organism.&nbsp; It may be induced
by injury, as, for instance, the presence of a marked growth such
as cancer.&nbsp; Here we have a more complex state, but
complexity of this kind is on the road to dissolution and
disintegration.&nbsp; Cancer, in fact, in the body is like
disaffection in an army.&nbsp; The unity is disturbed and
differences are engendered.&nbsp; Thus, given a measure of
nervous instability, a complexity may be induced, a
disintegration of the composite personality into the various
separate personalities, that bespeaks a lower, not a higher
organism. <a name="citation21"></a><a href="#footnote21"
class="citation">[21]</a></p>
<p>Now all this may seem quite impertinent to our subject, but I
have discussed the point at length because <!-- page 22--><a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>complexity is
certainly one of the marks of the Vagabond, and it is important
to make quite clear what is connoted by that term.</p>
<p>Recognizing, then, the two types of complexity, the type of
complexity with which I am concerned especially in these papers
is the higher type.&nbsp; I have not selected these writers
merely on account of their eccentricities or deviations from the
normal.&nbsp; Mere eccentricity has a legitimate interest for the
scientist, but for the psychologist it is of no particular
moment.&nbsp; Hazlitt is not interesting <i>because</i> he was
afflicted with a morbid egotism; or Borrow <i>because</i> he
suffered from fits of melancholia; or De Quincey <i>because</i>
he imagined he was in debt when he had plenty of money.&nbsp; It
was because these neurotic signs were associated with powerful
intellects and exceptional imaginations, and therefore gave a
peculiar and distinctive character to their writings&mdash;in
short, because they happened to be men of genius, men of higher
complex organisms than the average individual&mdash;that they
interest so strongly.</p>
<p>It seems to me a kind of inverted admiration that is attracted
to what is bizarre and out of the way, and confounds peculiarity
with cleverness and eccentricity with genius.</p>
<p>The real claim that individuals have upon our appreciation and
sympathy is mental and moral greatness; and the sentimental
weakness with the &ldquo;oddity&rdquo; is no more rational, no
more to be respected, than a sympathy which extends to physical
monstrosities and sees nothing to admire in a normal, healthy
body.</p>
<p>It may be urged, of course, by some that I have admitted <!--
page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>to a neurotic strain affecting more or less all the
Vagabonds treated of in this volume, and this being so, it is
clear that the morbid tendencies in their temperament must have
conditioned the distinctive character of their genius.</p>
<p>Now it is quite true that the soil whence the flower of their
genius sprung was in several cases not without a taint; but it
does not follow that the flower itself is tainted.&nbsp; And here
we come upon the fallacy that seems to me to lie at the basis of
the doctrine which makes genius itself a kind of disease.&nbsp;
The soil of the rose garden may be manured with refuse that
Nature uses in bringing forth the lovely bloom of the rose.&nbsp;
But the poisonous character of the refuse has been chemically
transformed in giving vitality to the roses.&nbsp; And so from
unhealthy stock, from temperaments affected by disease, have
sprung the roses of genius&mdash;transformed by the mysterious
alchemy of the imagination into pure and lovely things.&nbsp;
There are, of course, poisonous flowers, just as there is a type
of genius&mdash;not the highest type&mdash;that is morbid.&nbsp;
But this does not affect my contention that genius is not
necessarily morbid because it may have sprung from a morbid
soil.&nbsp; Hazlitt is a case in point.&nbsp; His temperament was
certainly not free from morbidity, and this morbidity may be
traced in his writings.&nbsp; The most signal instance is the
<i>Liber Amoris</i>&mdash;an unfortunate chapter of sentimental
autobiography which did irreparable mischief to his
reputation.&nbsp; But there is nothing morbid in Hazlitt at his
best; and let it be added that the bulk of Hazlitt&rsquo;s
writings displays a noble sanity.</p>
<p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>Much has been written about his less pleasing
idiosyncrasies, and no writer has been called more frequently to
account for deficiencies.&nbsp; It is time surely that we should
recall once more the tribute of Lamb: &ldquo;I think William
Hazlitt to be in his natural and healthy state one of the wisest
and finest spirits breathing.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>The complexity of Hazlitt&rsquo;s temperament was especially
emphasized by the two strong, opposing tendencies that called for
no ordinary power of co-ordination.&nbsp; I mean the austere,
individualistic, Puritan strain that came from his Presbyterian
forefathers; and a sensuous, voluptuous strain that often ran
athwart his Puritanism and occasioned him many a mental
struggle.&nbsp; The general effect of these two dements in his
nature was this: In matters of the intellect the Puritan was
uppermost; in the realm of the emotions you felt the dominant
presence of the opposing element.</p>
<p>In his finest essays one feels the presence at once of the
Calvinist and the Epicurean; not as two incompatibles, but as
opposing elements that have blent together into a noble unity;
would-be rivals that have co-ordinated so that from each the good
has been extracted, and the less worthy sides eliminated.&nbsp;
Thus the sweetness of the one and the strength of the other have
combined to give more distinction and power to the utterance.</p>
<p>Take this passage from one of his lectures:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The poet of nature is one who, from the
elements of <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>beauty, of power, and of passion in
his own breast, sympathises with whatever is beautiful, and
grand, and impassioned in nature, in its simple majesty, in its
immediate appeal to the senses, to the thoughts and hearts of all
men; so that the poet of nature, by the truth, and depth, and
harmony of his mind, may be said to hold communion with the very
soul of nature; to be identified with, and to foreknow, and to
record, the feelings of all men, at all times and places, as they
are liable to the same impressions; and to exert the same power
over the minds of his readers that nature does.&nbsp; He sees
things in their eternal beauty, for he sees them as they are; he
feels them in their universal interest, for he feels them as they
affect the first principles of his and our common nature.&nbsp;
Such was Homer, such was Shakespeare, whose works will last as
long as nature, because they are a copy of the indestructible
forms and everlasting impulses of feature, welling out from the
bosom as from a perennial spring, or stamped upon the senses by
the hand of their Maker.&nbsp; The power of the imagination in
them is the representative power of all nature.&nbsp; It has its
centre in the human soul, and makes the circuit of the
universe.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The child is a poet, in fact, when he first
plays at hide-and-seek, or repeats the story of Jack the
Giant-killer; the shepherd boy is a poet when he first crowns his
mistress with a garland of flowers; the countryman when he stops
to look at the rainbow; the city apprentice when he gazes after
the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s show; the miser when he hugs his gold; the
courtier who builds his hopes upon a smile; the savage who paints
his idol <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>with blood; the slave who worships a
tyrant, or the tyrant who fancies himself a god; the vain, the
ambitious, the proud, the choleric man, the hero and the coward,
the beggar and the king, the rich and the poor, the young and the
old, all live in a world of their own making; and the poet does
no more than describe what all the others think and
act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poetry is not a branch of authorship; it is the stuff
of which our life is made.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The artist is speaking in Hazlitt, but beneath the full, rich
exuberance of the artist, you can detect an under-note of
austerity.</p>
<p>Then again, his memorable utterance about the Dissenting
minister from one of his essays on &ldquo;Court
Influence.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A Dissenting minister is a character not so
easily to be dispensed with, and whose place cannot be well
supplied.&nbsp; It is a pity that this character has worn itself
out; that that pulse of thought and feeling has ceased almost to
beat in the heart of a nation, who, if not remarkable for
sincerity and plain downright well-meaning, are remarkable for
nothing.&nbsp; But we have known some such, in happier days, who
had been brought up and lived from youth to age in the one
constant belief in God and of His Christ, and who thought all
other things but dross compared with the glory hereafter to be
revealed.&nbsp; Their youthful hopes and vanity had been
mortified in them, even in their boyish days, by the neglect and
supercilious regards of the world; and they turned to look into
their own minds for something else to build their hopes and
confidence upon.&nbsp; They were <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>true
priests.&nbsp; They set up an image in their own minds&mdash;it
was truth; they worshipped an idol there&mdash;it was
justice.&nbsp; They looked on man as their brother, and only
bowed the knee to the Highest.&nbsp; Separate from the world,
they walked humbly with their God, and lived in thought with
those who had borne testimony of a good conscience, with the
spirits of just men in all ages. . . .&nbsp; Their sympathy was
not with the oppressors, but the oppressed.&nbsp; They cherished
in their thoughts&mdash;and wished to transmit to their
posterity&mdash;those rights and privileges for asserting which
their ancestors had bled on scaffolds, or had pined in dungeons,
or in foreign climes.&nbsp; Their creed, too, was &lsquo;Glory to
God, peace on earth, goodwill to man.&rsquo;&nbsp; This creed,
since profaned and rendered vile, they kept fast through good
report and evil report.&nbsp; This belief they had, that looks at
something out of itself, fixed as the stars, deep as the
firmament; that makes of its own heart an altar to truth, a place
of worship for what is right, at which it does reverence with
praise and prayer like a holy thing, apart and content; that
feels that the greatest Being in the universe is always near it;
and that all things work together for the good of His creatures,
under His guiding hand.&nbsp; This covenant they kept, as the
stars keep their courses; this principle they stuck by, for want
of knowing better, as it sticks by them to the last.&nbsp; It
grows with their growth, it does not wither in their decay.&nbsp;
It lives when the almond-tree flourishes, and is not bowed down
with the tottering knees.&nbsp; It glimmers with the last feeble
eyesight, smiles in the faded cheek like infancy, and lights a
path before them to the grave!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>Here is a man of Puritan lineage speaking; but is it the
voice of Puritanism only?&nbsp; Surely it is a Puritanism
softened and refined, a Puritanism which is free of those harsh
and unpleasing elements that have too often obscured its finer
aspects.&nbsp; I know of no passage in his writings which for
spacious eloquence, nobleness of thought, beauty of expression,
can rival this.&nbsp; It was written in 1818, when Hazlitt was
forty years old, and in the plenitude of his powers.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>But the power of co-ordination was not always exerted; perhaps
not always possible.&nbsp; Had it been so, then Hazlitt would not
take his place in this little band of literary Vagabonds.</p>
<p>There are times when the Puritan element disappears; and it is
Hazlitt the eager, curious taster of life that is presented to
us.&nbsp; For there was the restless inquisitiveness of the
Vagabond about him.&nbsp; This gives such delightful piquancy to
many of his utterances.&nbsp; He ranges far and wide, and is
willing to go anywhere for a fresh sensation that may add to the
interest of his intellectual life.&nbsp; He has no patience with
readers who will not quit their own small back gardens.&nbsp; He
is for ranging &ldquo;over the hills and far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sympathy he with the readers who take timid constitutionals
in literature, choosing only the well-worn paths.&nbsp; He is a
true son of the road; the world is before him, and high roads and
byways, rough paths and smooth paths, are equally acceptable,
provided they add to his zest and enjoyment.</p>
<p><!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>Not that he cares for the new merely because it is
new.&nbsp; The essay on &ldquo;Reading Old Books&rdquo; is proof
enough of that.&nbsp; A literary ramble must not merely be novel,
it must have some element of beauty about it, or he will revisit
the old haunts of whose beauty he has full cognizance.</p>
<p>The passion for the Earth which was noted as one of the
Vagabond&rsquo;s characteristics is not so pronounced in Hazlitt
and De Quincey as with the later Vagabonds.&nbsp; But it is
unmistakable all the same.&nbsp; There are, he says, &ldquo;only
three pleasures in life pure and lasting, and all derived from
inanimate things&mdash;books, pictures, and the face of
Nature.&rdquo;&nbsp; The somewhat curious use of the word
&ldquo;inanimate&rdquo; here as applied to the &ldquo;face of
Nature&rdquo; scarcely does justice to his intense, vivid
appreciation of the life of the open air; but at any rate it
differentiates his attitude towards Nature from that of
Wordsworth and his school.&nbsp; It is a feeling more direct,
more concrete, more personal.</p>
<p>He has no special liking for country people.&nbsp; On the
contrary, he thinks them a dull, heavy class of people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All country people hate one another,&rdquo; he
says.&nbsp; &ldquo;They have so little comfort that they envy
their neighbours the smallest pleasure and advantage, and nearly
grudge themselves the necessaries of life.&nbsp; From not being
accustomed to enjoyment, they become hardened and averse to
it&mdash;stupid, for want of thought, selfish, for want of
society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No; it is the sheer joy of being in the open, and learning
what Whitman called the &ldquo;profound lesson of <!-- page
30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>reception,&rdquo; that attracted Hazlitt.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What I like best,&rdquo; he declares, &ldquo;is to lie
whole mornings on a sunny bank on Salisbury Plain, without any
object before me, neither knowing nor caring how time passes, and
thus, &lsquo;with light-winged toys and feathered idleness, to
melt down hours to moments.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; A genuine
Vagabond mood this.</p>
<p>Hazlitt, like De Quincey, had felt the glamour of the city as
well as the glamour of the country; not with the irresistibility
of Lamb, but for all that potently.&nbsp; But an instinct for the
open, the craving for pleasant spaces, and the longing of the
hard-driven journalist for the gracious leisure of the country,
these things were paramount with both Hazlitt and De Quincey.</p>
<p>In Hazlitt&rsquo;s case there is a touch of wildness, a more
primal delight in the roughness and solitude of country places
than we find in De Quincey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the pleasantest things,&rdquo; says Hazlitt, in
true Vagabond spirit, &ldquo;is going on a journey; but I like to
go by myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last touch is not only characteristic of Hazlitt, it
touches that note of reserve verging on anti-social sentiment
that was mentioned as characteristic of the Vagabond.</p>
<p>He justifies his feeling thus with an engaging frankness:
&ldquo;The soul of a journey is liberty, perfect liberty, to
think, feel.&nbsp; Do just as one pleases.&nbsp; We go a journey
chiefly to be free of all impediments and of all inconveniences;
to leave ourselves behind; much more to get rid of others. . .
.&nbsp; It is hard if I cannot start some game on these lone
heaths.&nbsp; I laugh, I run, I leap, I <!-- page 31--><a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>sing for
joy.&nbsp; From the point of yonder rolling cloud I plunge into
my past being, and revel there, as the sunburnt Indian plunges
headlong into the wave that wafts him to his native shore.&nbsp;
Then long-forgotten things, like &lsquo;sunken wrack and sunless
treasures,&rsquo; burst upon my eager sight, and I begin to feel,
think, and be myself again.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>Taken on the whole, the English literary Vagabond is a man of
joy, not necessarily a cheerful man.&nbsp; There is a deeper
quality about joy than about cheerfulness.&nbsp; Cheerfulness
indeed is almost entirely a physical idiosyncrasy.&nbsp; It lies
on the surface.&nbsp; A man, serious and silent, may be a joyful
man; he can scarcely be a cheerful man.&nbsp; Moody as he was at
times, sour-tempered and whimsical as he could be, yet there was
a fine quality of joy about Hazlitt.&nbsp; It is this quality of
joy that gives the sparkle and relish to his essays.&nbsp; He
took the same joy in his books as in his walks, and he
communicates this joy to the reader.&nbsp; He appears
misanthropic at times, and rages violently at the world; but
&rsquo;tis merely a passing gust of feeling, and when over, it is
easy to see how superficial it was, so little is his general
attitude affected by it.</p>
<p>The joyfulness of the Vagabond is no mere light-hearted,
graceful spirit.&nbsp; It is of a hardy and virile nature&mdash;a
quality not to be crushed by misfortune or sickness.&nbsp;
Outwardly, neither the lives of Hazlitt nor De Quincey were what
we would call happy.&nbsp; Both had to fight hard against adverse
fates for many years; both <!-- page 32--><a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>had delicate
constitutions, which entailed weary and protracted periods of
feeble health.</p>
<p>But there was a fundamental serenity about them.&nbsp; At the
end of a hard and fruitless struggle with death, Hazlitt
murmured, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve had a happy life.&rdquo;&nbsp;
De Quincey at the close of his long and varied life showed the
same tranquil stoicism that had carried him through his many
difficulties.</p>
<p>Joyfulness permeates Thoreau&rsquo;s philosophy of life; and
until his system was shattered by a painful and incurable
complaint, Jefferies had the same splendid capacity for
enjoyment, a huge satisfaction in noting the splendour and rich
plenitude of the Earth.&nbsp; Whitman&rsquo;s fine optimism
defied every attack from without and within; and the deliberate
happiness of Stevenson, when temptation to despondency was so
strong, is one of his most attractive characteristics.</p>
<p>Yet the characteristic belongs to the English race, and it is
quite other with the Russian.&nbsp; Melancholy in his cast of
thought, and pessimistic in his philosophy, the Russian Vagabond
presents a striking contrast in this particular.</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p>Comparing the styles of Hazlitt and De Quincey, one is struck
with the greater fire and vigour of Hazlitt.</p>
<p>Indeed, the term which De Quincey applied to certain of his
writings&mdash;&ldquo;impassioned prose&rdquo;&mdash;is really
more applicable to many of Hazlitt&rsquo;s essays.&nbsp; The
dream fugues of De Quincey are delicately imaginative, but <!--
page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>real passion is absent from them.&nbsp; The silvery,
far-away tones of the opium-eater do not suggest passion.</p>
<p>Besides, an elaborate, involved style such as his does not
readily convey passion of any kind.&nbsp; It moves along too
slowly, at too leisurely a pace.&nbsp; On the other hand, the
prose of Hazlitt was very frequently literally
&ldquo;impassioned.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was sharp, concise, the
sentences rang out resolutely and clearly.&nbsp; And no veil of
phantasy hung at these times between himself and the object of
his description, as with De Quincey, muffling the voice and
blurring the vision.&nbsp; Defects it had, which there is no
necessity to dwell on here, but there was a passion in
Hazlitt&rsquo;s nature and writings which we do not find in his
contemporary.</p>
<p>Trying beyond doubt as was the wayward element in
Hazlitt&rsquo;s disposition, to his friends it is not without its
charm as a literary characteristic.&nbsp; His bitterness against
Coleridge in his later years leads him to dwell the longer upon
the earlier meetings, upon the Coleridge of Wem and Nether
Stowey, and thus his very prejudices leave his readers frequently
as gainers.</p>
<p>A passing whim, a transient resentment, will be the occasion
of some finely discursive essay on abstract virtues and
vices.&nbsp; And, after all, there is at bottom such noble
enthusiasm in the man, and where his subjects were not living
people, and his judgment is not blinded by some small prejudices,
how fair, how just, how large and admirable his view.&nbsp; His
faults and failings were of such a character as to bring upon the
owner their own retribution.&nbsp; He paid heavily for his
mistakes.&nbsp; His splenetic moods and his violent dislikes
arose not from <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>a want of sensibility, but from an
excess of sensibility.&nbsp; So I do not think they need
seriously disturb us.&nbsp; After all, the dagger he uses as a
critic is uncommonly like a stage weapon, and does no serious
damage.</p>
<p>Better even than his brilliant, suggestive, if capricious,
criticisms are his discursive essays on men and things.&nbsp;
These abound in a tonic wisdom, a breadth of imagination as
welcome as they are rare.</p>

37</span>I</h3>
<p>Although a passion for the Earth is a prevalent note in the
character of the literary Vagabond, yet while harking to the call
of the country, he is by no means deaf to the call of the
town.&nbsp; With the exception of Thoreau, who seemed to have
been insensible to any magic save that of the road and woodland,
our literary Vagabonds have all felt and confessed to the spell
of the city.&nbsp; It was not, as in the case of Lamb and
Dickens, the one compelling influence, but it was an influence of
no small potency.</p>
<p>The first important event in De Quincey&rsquo;s life was the
roaming life on the hillside of North Wales; the second, the
wanderings in &ldquo;stony-hearted Oxford Street.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Later on the spell of London faded away, and a longing for the
country possessed him once more.&nbsp; But the spell of London
was important in shaping his literary life, and must not be
under-estimated.&nbsp; Mention has been made of Lamb and Dickens,
to whom the life of the town meant so much, and whose inspiration
they could not forgo without a pang.&nbsp; But these men were not
attracted in the same way as De Quincey.&nbsp; What drew De
Quincey to London was its mystery; whereas it was the stir and
colour of the crowded streets that <!-- page 38--><a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>stirred the
imagination of the two Charles&rsquo;s.&nbsp; We scarcely realize
as we read of those harsh experiences, those bitter struggles
with poverty and loneliness, that the man is writing of his life
in London, is speaking of some well-known thoroughfares.&nbsp; It
is like viewing a familiar scene in the moonlight, when all looks
strange and weird.&nbsp; A faint but palpable veil of phantasy
seemed to shut off De Quincey from the outside world.&nbsp; In
his most poignant passages the voice has a ghostly ring; in his
most realistic descriptions there is a dreamlike unreality.&nbsp;
A tender and sensitive soul in his dealings with others, there
are no tears in his writings.&nbsp; One has only to compare the
early recorded struggles of Dickens with those of De Quincey to
feel the difference between the two temperaments.&nbsp; The one
passionately concrete, the other dispassionately abstract.&nbsp;
De Quincey will take some heartfelt episode and deck it out in so
elaborate a panoply of rhetoric that the human element seems to
have vanished.&nbsp; Beautiful as are many of the passages
describing the pathetic outcast Ann, the reader is too conscious
of the stylist and the full-dress stylist.</p>
<p>That he feels what he is writing of, one does not doubt; but
he does not suit his manner to his matter.&nbsp; For expressing
subtle emotions, half shades of thought, no writer is more
wonderfully adept than De Quincey.&nbsp; But when the episode
demands simple and direct treatment his elaborate cadences feel
out of place.</p>
<p>When he pauses in his description to apostrophize, then the
disparity affects one far less; as, for instance, in this
apostrophe to &ldquo;noble-minded&rdquo; Ann after recalling how
on one occasion she had saved his life.</p>

<p>Perhaps the passage describing how he befriended the small
servant girl in the half-deserted house in Greek Street is among
the happiest, despite a note of artificiality towards the
close:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Towards nightfall I went down to Greek
Street, and found, on taking possession of my new quarters, that
the house already contained one single inmate&mdash;a poor,
friendless child, apparently ten years old; but she seemed
hunger-bitten; and sufferings of that sort often make children
look older than they are.&nbsp; From this forlorn child I learned
that she had slept and lived there alone for some time before I
came; and great joy the poor creature expressed when she found
that I was in future to be her companion through the hours of
darkness.&nbsp; The house could hardly be called large&mdash;that
is, it was not large on each separate storey; but, having four
storeys in all, it was large enough to impress vividly the sense
of its echoing loneliness; and, from the want <!-- page 40--><a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>of furniture,
the noise of the rats made a prodigious uproar on the staircase
and hall; so that, amidst the real fleshly ills of cold and
hunger, the forsaken child had found leisure to suffer still more
from the self-created one of ghosts.&nbsp; Against these enemies
I could promise her protection; human companionship was in itself
protection; but of other and more needful aid I had, alas! little
to offer.&nbsp; We lay upon the floor, with a bundle of law
papers for a pillow, but with no other covering than a large
horseman&rsquo;s cloak; afterwards, however, we discovered in a
garret an old sofa-cover, a small piece of rug, and some
fragments of other articles, which added a little to our
comfort.&nbsp; The poor child crept close to me for warmth, and
for security against her ghostly enemies. . . .&nbsp; Apart from
her situation, she was not what would be called an interesting
child.&nbsp; She was neither pretty, nor quick in understanding,
nor remarkably pleasing in manners.&nbsp; But, thank God! even in
those years I needed not the embellishments of elegant
accessories to conciliate my affections.&nbsp; Plain human
nature, in its humblest and most homely apparel, was enough for
me; and I loved the child because she was my partner in
wretchedness.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>I cannot agree with Mr. H. S. Salt when, in the course of a
clever and interesting biographical study of De Quincey, <a
name="citation40"></a><a href="#footnote40"
class="citation">[40]</a> he says: &ldquo;It (in <i>re</i> style)
conveys precisely the sense that is intended, and attains its
effect far less by <!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>rhetorical artifice than by an almost
faultless instinct in the choice and use of words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the delineation of certain moods he is supremely
excellent.&nbsp; But surely the style is not a plastic style; and
its appeal to the ear rather than to the pictorial faculty limits
its emotional effect upon the reader.&nbsp; Images pass before
his eyes, and he tries to depict them by cunningly devised
phrases; but the veil of phantasy through which he sees those
images has blurred their outline and dimmed their
colouring.&nbsp; The phrase arrests by its musical cadences, by
its solemn, mournful music.&nbsp; Even some of his most admirable
pieces&mdash;the dream fugues, leave the reader dissatisfied,
when they touch poignant realities like sorrow.&nbsp; Despite its
many beauties, that dream fugue, &ldquo;Our Ladies of
Sorrow,&rdquo; seems too misty, too ethereal in texture for the
intense actuality of the subject.&nbsp; Compare some of its
passages with passages from another prose-poet, Oscar Wilde,
where no veil of phantasy comes between the percipient and the
thing perceived, and it will be strange if the reader does not
feel that the later writer has a finer instinct for the choice
and use of words.</p>
<p>It would be untrue to say that Wilde&rsquo;s instinct was
faultless.&nbsp; A garish artificiality spoils much of his work;
but this was through wilful perversity.&nbsp; Even in his earlier
work&mdash;in that wonderful book, <i>Dorian Gray</i>, he
realized the compelling charm of simplicity in style.&nbsp; His
fairy stories, <i>The Happy Prince</i>, for instance, are little
masterpieces of simple, restrained writing, and in the last
things that came from his pen there is a growing appreciation of
the value of simplicity.</p>
<p><!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>De Quincey never realized this; he recognized one form
of art&mdash;the decorative.&nbsp; And although he became a
master of that form, it was inevitable that at times this mode of
art should fail in its effect.</p>
<p>Here is a passage from <i>Levana and Our Ladies of
Sorrow</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The eldest of the three is named Mater
Lachrymarum, Our Lady of Tears.&nbsp; She it is that night and
day raves and moans, calling for vanished faces.&nbsp; She stood
in Rama, where a voice was heard of lamentation&mdash;Rachel
weeping for her children, and refusing to be comforted.&nbsp; She
it was that stood in Bethlehem on the night when Herod&rsquo;s
sword swept its nurseries of Innocents, and the little feet were
stiffened for ever which were heard at times as they trotted
along floors overhead, woke pulses of love in household hearts
that were not unmarked in heaven.&nbsp; Her eyes are sweet and
subtle; wild and sleepy by turns; often times rising to the
clouds, often times challenging the heavens.&nbsp; She wears a
diadem round her head.&nbsp; And I knew by childish memories that
she could go abroad upon the winds, when she heard the sobbing of
litanies or the thundering of organs, and when she beheld the
mustering of summer clouds.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here is Oscar Wilde in <i>De Profundis</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Prosperity, pleasure, and success, may be
rough of grain and common in fibre, but sorrow is the most
sensitive of all created things.&nbsp; There is nothing that
stirs in the whole world of thought to which sorrow does not
vibrate in terrible and exquisite pulsation. . . .&nbsp; It is a
wound that bleeds when any hand but that of love <!-- page
43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>touches it, and even then must bleed again, though not
in pain.&nbsp; Behind joy and laughter there may be a temperament
coarse, hard, and callous.&nbsp; But behind sorrow there is
always sorrow.&nbsp; Pain, unlike pleasure, wears no mask.&nbsp;
Truth in Art is . . . no echo coming from a hollow hill, any more
than it is a silver well of water in the valley that shows the
moon to the moon, and Narcissus to Narcissus.&nbsp; Truth in Art
is the unity of a thing with itself&mdash;the soul made
incarnate, the body instinct with spirit.&nbsp; For this reason
there is no truth comparable to sorrow.&nbsp; There are times
when sorrow seems to me to be the only truth.&nbsp; Other things
may be illusions of the eye or the appetite made to blind the one
and clog the other, but out of sorrow have the worlds been built,
and at the birth of a child or a star there is pain.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have not quoted these passages in order to pit one style
against another; for each writer sets himself about a different
task.&nbsp; A &ldquo;dream fugue&rdquo; demands a treatment other
than the simpler, more direct treatment essential for
Wilde&rsquo;s purpose.&nbsp; It is not because De Quincey the
artist chose this especial form for once in order to portray a
mood that the passage merits consideration; but because De
Quincey always treated his emotional experiences as &ldquo;dream
fugues.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of suffering and privation, of pain and
anguish bodily and mental, he had experiences more than the
common lot.&nbsp; But when he tries to show this bleeding reality
to us a mist invariably arises, and we see things &ldquo;as in a
glass darkly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a certain passage in his Autobiography which affords
a key to this characteristic of his work.</p>
<p><!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>When quite a boy he had constituted himself imaginary
king of an imaginary kingdom of Gombrom.&nbsp; Speaking of this
fancy he writes: &ldquo;O reader! do not laugh!&nbsp; I lived for
ever under the terror of two separate wars and two separate
worlds; one against the factory boys in a real world of flesh and
blood, of stones and brickbats, of flight and pursuit, that were
anything but figurative; the other in a world purely aerial,
where all the combats and the sufferings were absolute
moonshine.&nbsp; And yet the simple truth is that for anxiety and
distress of mind the reality (which almost every morning&rsquo;s
light brought round) was as nothing in comparison of that Dream
Kingdom which rose like a vapour from my own brain, and which
apparently by the fiat of my will could be for ever
dissolved.&nbsp; Ah, but no!&nbsp; I had contracted obligations
to Gombrom; I had submitted my conscience to a yoke; and in
secret truth my will had no autocratic power.&nbsp; Long
contemplation of a shadow, earnest study for the welfare of that
shadow, sympathy with the wounded sensibilities of that shadow
under accumulated wrongs; these bitter experiences, nursed by
brooding thought, had gradually frozen that shadow into a region
of reality far denser than the material realities of brass or
granite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This confession is a remarkable testimony to the reality of De
Quincey&rsquo;s imaginative life.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had contracted
obligations to Gombrom.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, despite his practical
experiences with the world, it was Gombrom, &ldquo;the
moonlight&rdquo; side of things, that appealed to him.&nbsp; The
boys might fling stones and brickbats, just as the world did
later&mdash;but though he felt the onslaught, it <!-- page
45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>moved
him far less than did the phantasies of his imagination.</p>
<p>There is no necessity to weigh Wilde&rsquo;s experiences of
&ldquo;Our Ladies of Sorrow&rdquo; beside those of De
Quincey.&nbsp; All we need ask is which impresses us the more
keenly with the actuality of sorrow.&nbsp; And I think there can
be no doubt that it is not De Quincey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Dream Kingdom that rose like a vapour&rdquo; from
his brain, this it was&mdash;this Vagabond imagination of
his&mdash;that was the one great reality in life.&nbsp; It is a
mistake to assume, as some have done, that this faculty for
daydreaming was a legacy of the opium-eating.&nbsp; The opium
gave an added brilliance to the dream-life, but it did not create
it.&nbsp; He was a dreamer from his birth&mdash;a far more
thorough-going dreamer than was ever Coleridge.&nbsp; There was a
strain of insanity about him undoubtedly, and it says much for
his intellectual activity and moral power that the Dream Kingdom
did not disturb his mental life more than it did.&nbsp; Had he
never touched opium to relieve his gastric complaint, he would
have been eccentric&mdash;that is, if he had lived.&nbsp; Without
some narcotic it is doubtful whether his highly sensitive
organization would have survived the attacks of disease.&nbsp; As
it was, the opium not only eased the pain, but lifted his
imagination above the ugly realities of life, and afforded a
solace in times of loneliness and misery.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>Intellectually he was a man of a conservative turn of mind,
with an ingrained respect for the conventions of <!-- page
46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>life,
but temperamentally he was a restless Vagabond, with a total
disregard for the amenities of civilization, asking for nothing
except to live out his own dream-life.&nbsp; Dealing with him as
a writer, you found a shrewd, if wayward critic, with no little
of &ldquo;John Bull&rdquo; in his composition.&nbsp; Deal with
him as a man, you found a bright, kindly, nervous little man in a
chronic state of shabbiness, eluding the attention of friends so
far as possible, and wandering about town and country as if he
had nothing in common with the rest of mankind.&nbsp; His
Vagabondage is shown best in his purely imaginative work, and in
the autobiographical sketches.</p>
<p>Small and insignificant in appearance to the casual observer,
there was something arresting, fascinating about the man that
touched even the irascible Carlyle.&nbsp; Much of his work, one
can well understand, seemed to this lover of facts &ldquo;full of
wire-drawn ingenuities.&rdquo;&nbsp; But with all his contempt
for phantasy, there was a touch of the dreamer in Carlyle, and
the imaginative beauty, apart from the fanciful prettiness in De
Quincey&rsquo;s work, would have appealed to him.&nbsp; For there
was power, intellectual grip, behind the shifting fancies, and
both as a critic and historian he has left behind him memorable
work.&nbsp; As critic he has been taken severely to task for his
judgments on French writers and on many lights of
eighteenth-century thought.&nbsp; Certainly De Quincey&rsquo;s
was not the type of mind we should go to for an interpretative
criticism of the eighteenth century.&nbsp; Yet we must not forget
his admirable appreciation of Goldsmith.&nbsp; At his best, as in
his criticism of Milton and <!-- page 47--><a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>Wordsworth,
he shows a fine, delicate, analytical power, which it is hard to
overpraise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obligations to Gombrom&rdquo; do not afford the best
qualification for the historian.&nbsp; One can imagine the hair
rising in horror on the head of the late Professor Freeman at the
idea of the opium-eater sitting down seriously to write
history.</p>
<p>Yet he had, like Froude, the power of seizing upon the
spectacular side of great movements which many a more accurate
historian has lacked.&nbsp; Especially striking is his <i>Revolt
of the Tartars</i>&mdash;the flight eastward of a Tartar nation
across the vast steppes of Asia, from Russia to Chinese
territory.&nbsp; Ideas impressed him rather than facts, and
episodes rather than a continuous chain of events.&nbsp; But when
he was interested, he had the power of describing with
picturesque power certain dramatic episodes in a nation&rsquo;s
history.</p>
<p>A characteristic of the literary Vagabond is the eager
versatility of his intellectual interests.&nbsp; He will follow
any path that promises to be interesting, not so much with the
scholar&rsquo;s patient investigation as with the
pedestrian&rsquo;s delight in &ldquo;fresh woods and pastures
new.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A prolific writer for the magazines, it is inevitable that
there should be a measure that is ephemeral in De Quincey&rsquo;s
voluminous writings.&nbsp; But it is impossible not to be struck
by the wide range of his intellectual interests.&nbsp; A mind
that is equally at home in the economics of Ricardo and the
transcendentalism of Wordsworth; that can turn with undiminished
zest from Malthus to Kant; that could deal lucidly with the
&ldquo;Logic of Political Economy,&rdquo; despite the dream-world
that finds expression <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>in the &ldquo;impassioned
prose&rdquo;; that could delight in such broadly farcical
absurdities as &ldquo;<i>Sortilege and Astrology</i>,&rdquo; and
such delicately suggestive studies as &ldquo;On the Knocking at
the Gate in Macbeth,&rdquo; a mind of this adventurous and varied
type is assuredly a very remarkable one.&nbsp; That he should
touch every subject with equal power was not to be expected, but
the analytic brilliance that characterizes even his mystical
writings enabled him to treat such subjects as political economy
with a sureness of touch and a logical grasp that has astonished
those who had regarded him as merely an inconsequential dreamer
of dreams.</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>I cannot agree with Dr. Japp <a name="citation48"></a><a
href="#footnote48" class="citation">[48]</a> when, in the course
of some laudatory remarks on De Quincey&rsquo;s humour, he says:
&ldquo;It is precisely here that De Quincey parts company, alike
from Coleridge and from Wordsworth; neither of them had
humour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the first place De Quincey&rsquo;s humour never seems to me
very genuine.&nbsp; He could play with ideas occasionally in a
queer fantastic way, as in his elaborate gibe on Dr. Andrew
Bell.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;First came Dr. Andrew Bell.&nbsp; We knew
him.&nbsp; Was he dull?&nbsp; Is a wooden spoon dull?&nbsp; Fishy
were his eyes, torpedinous was his manner; and his main idea, out
of two which he really had, related to the moon&mdash;from which
you infer, perhaps, that he was lunatic.&nbsp; <!-- page 49--><a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>By no
means.&nbsp; It was no craze, under the influence of the moon,
which possessed him; it was an idea of mere hostility to the
moon. . . .&nbsp; His wrath did not pass into lunacy; it produced
simple distraction; and uneasy fumbling with the idea&mdash;like
that of an old superannuated dog who longs to worry, but cannot
for want of teeth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A clever piece of analytical satire, if you like, but not
humorous so much as witty.&nbsp; Incongruity, unexpectedness,
belongs to the essence of humour.&nbsp; Here there is that
cunning display of congruity between the old dog and the Doctor
which the wit is so adroit in evolving.</p>
<p>Similarly in the essay on &ldquo;Murder considered as one of
the Fine Arts,&rdquo; the style of clever extravaganza adopted in
certain passages is witty, certainly, but lacks the airy
irresponsibility characterizing humour.&nbsp; Sometimes he
indulges in pure clowning, which is humorous in a heavy-handed
way.&nbsp; But grimacing humour is surely a poor kind of
humour.</p>
<p>Without going into any dismal academic discussion on Wit and
Humour, I think it is quite possible to differentiate these two
offsprings of imagination, making Wit the intellectual brother of
the twain.&nbsp; Analytical minds naturally turn to wit, by
preference: Impressionistic minds to humour.&nbsp; Dickens, who
had no gift for analysis, and whose writings are a series of
delightful unreflective, personal impressions, is always
humorous, never witty.&nbsp; Reflective writers like George Eliot
or George Meredith are more often witty than humorous.</p>
<p>I do not rate De Quincey&rsquo;s wit very highly, though it
<!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>is agreeably diverting at times, but it was preferable
to his humour.</p>
<p>The second point to be noted against Dr. Japp is his reference
to Coleridge.&nbsp; No one would claim Wordsworth as a humorist,
but Coleridge cannot be dismissed with this comfortable
finality.&nbsp; Perhaps he was more witty than humorous; he also
had an analytic mind of rarer quality even than De
Quincey&rsquo;s, and his <i>Table Talk</i> is full of delightful
flashes.&nbsp; But the amusing account he gives of his early
journalistic experiences and the pleasant way in which he pokes
fun at himself, can scarcely be compatible with the assertion
that he had &ldquo;no humour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, it was this quality, I think, which endeared him
especially to Lamb, and it was the absence of this quality which
prevented Lamb from giving that personal attachment to Wordsworth
which he held for both Coleridge and Hazlitt.</p>
<p>But the comparative absence of humour in De Quincey is another
characteristic of Vagabondage.&nbsp; Humour is largely a product
of civilization, and the Vagabond is only half-civilized.&nbsp; I
can see little genuine humour in either Hazlitt or De
Quincey.&nbsp; They had wit to an extent, it is true, but they
had this despite, not because, of their Vagabondage.&nbsp;
Thoreau, notwithstanding flashes of shrewd American wit, can
scarcely be accounted a humorist.&nbsp; Whitman was entirely
devoid of humour.&nbsp; A lack of humour is felt as a serious
deficiency in reading the novels of Jefferies; and the airy wit
of Stevenson is scarcely full-bodied enough to rank him among the
humorists.</p>
<p><!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>This deficiency of humour may be traced to the
characteristic attitude of the Vagabond towards life, which is
one of eager curiosity.&nbsp; He is inquisitive about its many
issues, but with a good deal of the child&rsquo;s eagerness to
know how a thing happened, and who this is, and what that
is.&nbsp; Differing in many ways, as did Borrow and De Quincey,
we find the same insatiable curiosity; true, it expressed itself
differently, but there is a basic similarity between the impulse
that took Borrow over the English highways and gave him that zest
for travel in other countries, and the impulse that sent De
Quincey wandering over the various roads of intellectual and
emotional inquiry.&nbsp; Thoreau&rsquo;s main reason for his two
years&rsquo; sojourn in the woods was one of curiosity.&nbsp; He
&ldquo;wanted to know&rdquo; what he could find out by
&ldquo;fronting&rdquo; for a while the essential facts of life,
and he left, as he says, &ldquo;for as good a reason as I went
there.&nbsp; Perhaps it seemed to me that I had several more
lives to live.&rdquo;&nbsp; In other words, inquisitiveness
inspired the experiment, and inquisitiveness as to other
experiments induced him to terminate the Walden episode.</p>
<p>Now, in his own way, De Quincey was possibly the most
inquisitive of all the Vagabonds.&nbsp; The complete absence of
the imperative mood in his writings has moved certain moralists
like Carlyle to impatience with him.&nbsp; There is a fine moral
tone about his disposition, but his writings are engagingly
unmoral (quite different, of course, from immoral).&nbsp; He has
called himself &ldquo;an intellectual creature,&rdquo; and this
happy epithet exactly describes him.&nbsp; He collected facts, as
an enthusiast collects curios, for purposes of decoration.&nbsp;
He observed them, <!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>analysed their features, but almost
always with a view to &aelig;sthetic comparisons.</p>
<p>And to understand De Quincey aright one must follow him in his
multitudinous excursions, not merely rest content with a few
fragments of &ldquo;impassioned prose,&rdquo; and the avowedly
autobiographic writings.&nbsp; For the autobiography extends
through the sixteen volumes of his works.&nbsp; The writings, no
doubt, vary in quality; in many, as in the criticism of German
and French writers, acute discernment and astounding prejudices
jostle one another.&nbsp; But this is no reason for turning
impatiently away.&nbsp; Indeed, it is an additional incentive to
proceed, for they supply such splendid psychological material for
illustrating the temperament and tastes of the writer.&nbsp; And
this may confidently be said: There is &ldquo;fundamental
brainwork&rdquo; in every article that De Quincey has
written.</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p>What gives his works their especial attraction is not so much
the analytic faculty, interesting as it is, or the mystical turn
of mind, as in the piquant blend of the two.&nbsp; Thus, while he
is poking fun at Astrology or Witchcraft, we are conscious all
the time that he retains a sneaking fondness for the
occult.&nbsp; He delights in dreams, omens, and
coincidences.&nbsp; He reminds one at times of the lecturer on
&ldquo;Superstitions,&rdquo; who, in the midst of a brilliant
analysis of its futility and absurdity, was interrupted by a
black cat walking on to the platform, and was so disturbed by
this portent that he brought his lecture to an abrupt
conclusion.</p>
<p><!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>On the whole the Mystic trampled over the
Logician.&nbsp; His poetic imagination impresses his work with a
rich inventiveness, while the logical faculty, though subsidiary,
is utilized for giving form and substance to the visions.</p>
<p>It is curious to contrast the stateliness of De
Quincey&rsquo;s literary style, the elaborate full-dress manner,
with the extreme simplicity of the man.&nbsp; One might be
tempted to add, surely here the style is <i>not</i> the
man.&nbsp; His friends have testified that he was a gentle,
timid, shrinking little man, and abnormally sensitive to giving
offence; and to those whom he cared for&mdash;his family, for
instance&mdash;he was the incarnation of affection and
tenderness.</p>
<p>Yet in the writings we see another side, a considerable
sprinkle of sturdy prejudices, no little self-assertion and
pugnacity.&nbsp; But there is no real disparity.&nbsp; The style
is the man here as ever.&nbsp; When roused by opposition he could
even in converse show the claws beneath the velvet.&nbsp; Only
the militant, the more aggressive side of the man is expressed
more readily in his writings.&nbsp; And the gentle and amiable
side more readily in personal intimacy.&nbsp; Both the life and
the writings are wanted to supply a complete picture.</p>
<p>In one respect the records of his life efface a suspicion that
haunts the reader of his works.&nbsp; More than once the reader
is apt to speculate as to how far the arrogance that marks
certain of his essays is a superficial quality, a literary trick;
how far a moral trait.&nbsp; The record of his conversations
tends to show that much of this was merely surface.&nbsp; Unlike
Coleridge, unlike Carlyle, he was as willing to listen as to
talk; and he said many of his best things with a delightful
unconsciousness that <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>they were especially good.&nbsp; He
never seemed to have the least wish to impress people by his
cleverness or aptness of speech.</p>
<p>But when all has been said as to the personality of the man as
expressed in his writings&mdash;especially his
<i>Confessions</i>, and to his personality as interpreted by
friends and acquaintances&mdash;there remains a measure of
mystery about De Quincey.&nbsp; This is part of his fascination,
just as it is part of the fascination attaching to
Coleridge.&nbsp; The frank confidences of his <i>Confessions</i>
hide from view the inner ring of reserve, which gave a strange
impenetrability to his character, even to those who knew and
loved him best.&nbsp; A simple nature and a complex
temperament.</p>
<p>Well, after all, such personalities are the most interesting
of all, for each time we greet them it is with a note of
interrogation.</p>

<p>Why is it that almost as soon as we can toddle we eagerly
demand a story of our elders?&nbsp; Why is it that the most
excitable little girl, the most incorrigible little boy can be
quieted by a teaspoonful of the jam of fiction?&nbsp; Why is it
that &ldquo;once upon a time&rdquo; can achieve what moral
strictures are powerless to effect?</p>
<p>It is because to most of us the world of imagination is the
world that matters.&nbsp; We live in the &ldquo;might
be&rsquo;s&rdquo; and &ldquo;peradventures.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fate may
have cast our lot in prosaic places; have predetermined our lives
on humdrum lines; but it cannot touch our dreams.&nbsp; There we
are princes, princesses&mdash;possessed of illimitable wealth,
wielding immeasurable power.&nbsp; Our bodies may traverse the
same dismal streets day after day; but our minds rove luxuriantly
through all the kingdoms of the earth.</p>
<p>Those wonderful eastern stories of the &ldquo;Flying
Horse&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Magic Carpet,&rdquo; symbolize for us
the matter-of-fact world and the matter-of-dream world.&nbsp;
Nay, is there any sound distinction between facts and
dreams?&nbsp; After all&mdash;</p>

<p><!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>But there are dreams and dreams&mdash;dreams by
moonlight and dreams by sunlight.&nbsp; Literature can boast of
many fascinating moonlight dreams&mdash;Ancient Mariners and
Christabels, Wonder Books and Tanglewood Tales.&nbsp; And the
fairies and goblins, the witches and wizards, were they not born
by moonlight and nurtured under the glimmer of the stars?</p>
<p>But there are dreams by sunlight and visions at noonday
also.&nbsp; Such dreams thrill us in another but no less
unmistakable way, especially when the dreamer is a Scott, a
William Morris, a Borrow.</p>
<p>And dreamers like Borrow are not content to see visions and
dream dreams, their bodies must participate no less than their
minds.&nbsp; They must needs set forth in quest of the
unknown.&nbsp; Hardships and privations deter them not.&nbsp;
Change, variety, the unexpected, these things are to them the
very salt of life.</p>
<p>This untiring restlessness keeps a Richard Burton rambling
over Eastern lands, turns a Borrow into the high-road and
dingle.&nbsp; This bright-eyed Norfolk giant took more kindly to
the roughnesses of life than did Hazlitt and De Quincey.&nbsp;
Quite as neurotic in his way, his splendid physique makes us
think of him as the embodiment of fine health.&nbsp; Illness and
Borrow do not agree.&nbsp; We think of him swinging along the
road like one of Dumas&rsquo; lusty adventurers, exhibiting his
powers of horsemanship, holding his own with well-seasoned
drinkers&mdash;especially if the drink be Norfolk
ale&mdash;conversing with any picturesque rag-tag and bob-tail he
might happen upon.&nbsp; There is plenty of fresh air in his
pages.&nbsp; No thinker like Hazlitt, no dreamer like De <!--
page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>Quincey; but a shrewd observer with the most amazing
knack of ingratiating himself with strangers.</p>
<p>No need for this romancer to seek distant lands for
inspiration.&nbsp; Not even the villages of Spain and Portugal
supplied him with such fine stuff for romance as Mumper&rsquo;s
Dingle.&nbsp; He would get as strange a story out of a London
counting-house or an old apple-woman on London Bridge as did many
a teller of tales out of lonely heaths and stormy seas.</p>
<p><i>Lavengro</i> and <i>The Romany Rye</i> are fine specimens
of romantic autobiography.&nbsp; His life was varied enough,
abounding in colour; but the Vagabond is never satisfied with
things that merely happen.&nbsp; He is equally concerned with the
things that might happen, with the things that ought to
happen.&nbsp; And so Borrow added to his own personal record from
the storehouse of dreams.&nbsp; Some have blamed him for not
adhering to the actual facts.&nbsp; But does any autobiographer
adhere to actual facts?&nbsp; Can any man, even with the most
sensitive feeling for accuracy, confine himself to a record of
what happened?</p>
<p>Of course not.&nbsp; The moment a man begins to write about
himself, to delve in the past, to ransack the storehouse of his
memory; then&mdash;if he has anything of the literary artist
about him, and otherwise his book will not be worth the paper it
is written on&mdash;he will take in a partner to assist
him.&nbsp; That partner&rsquo;s name is Romance.</p>
<p>As a revelation of temperament, the <i>Confessions</i> of
Rousseau and the <i>M&eacute;moires</i> of Casanova are, one
feels, delightfully trustworthy.&nbsp; But no sane reader ever
<!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>imagines that he is reading an accurate transcript from
the life of these adventurous gentlemen.&nbsp; The difference
between the editions of De Quincey&rsquo;s <i>Opium Eater</i> is
sufficient to show how the dreams have expanded under popular
approbation.</p>
<p>Borrow himself suggests this romantic method when he says,
&ldquo;What is an autobiography?&nbsp; Is it a mere record of a
man&rsquo;s life, or is it a picture of the man
himself?&rdquo;&nbsp; Certainly, no one carried the romantic
colouring further than he did.&nbsp; When he started to write his
own life in <i>Lavengro</i> he had no notion of diverging from
the strict line of fact.&nbsp; But the adventurer Vagabond moved
uneasily in the guise of the chronicler.&nbsp; He wanted more
elbow-room.&nbsp; He remembered all that he hoped to encounter,
and from hopes it was no far cry to actualities.</p>
<p>Things might have happened so!&nbsp; Ye gods, they <i>did</i>
happen so!&nbsp; And after all it matters little to us the exact
proportion of fact and fiction.&nbsp; What does matter is that
the superstructure he has raised upon the foundation of fact is
as strange and unique as the palace of Aladdin.</p>
<p>However much he suggested the typical Anglo-Saxon in real
life, there was the true Celt whenever he took pen in hand.</p>
<p>A stranger blend of the Celt and the Saxon indeed it would be
hard to find.&nbsp; The Celtic side is not uppermost in his
temperament&mdash;this strong, assertive, prize-fighting,
beer-loving man (a good drinker, but never a drunkard) seems far
more Saxon than anything else.&nbsp; De Quincey had no small
measure of the John Bull in 
<a href="images/p60.jpg">

</a><!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>his temperament, and Borrow had a great deal more.&nbsp;
The John Bull side was very obvious.&nbsp; Yet a Celt he was by
parentage, and the Celtic part was unmistakable, though below the
surface.&nbsp; If the East Anglian in him had a weakness for
athleticism, boiled mutton and caper sauce, the Celt in him
responded quickly to the romantic associates of Wales.</p>
<p>Readers of Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s charming romance
<i>Aylwin</i> will recall the emphasis laid on the passionate
love of the Welsh for a tiny strip of Welsh soil.&nbsp; Borrow
understood all this; he had a rare sympathy with the Cymric
Celt.&nbsp; You can trace the Celt in his scenic descriptions, in
his feeling for the spell of antiquity, his restlessness of
spirit.&nbsp; And yet in his appearance there was little to
suggest the Celt.&nbsp; Small wonder that many of his friends
spoke of this white-haired giant of six foot three as if he was
first and foremost an excellent athlete.</p>
<p>Certainly he had in full measure an Englishman&rsquo;s delight
and proficiency in athletics&mdash;few better at running,
jumping, wrestling, sparring, and swimming.</p>
<p>In many respects indeed Borrow will not have realized the
fancy picture of the Englishman as limned by Hawthorne&rsquo;s
fancy&mdash;the big, hearty, self-opiniated, beef-eating,
ale-drinking John Bull.&nbsp; Save to a few intimates like Mr.
Watts-Dunton and Dr. Hake he seems to have concealed very
effectually the Celtic sympathies in his nature.&nbsp; But no
reader of his books can be blind to this side of his character;
and then again, as in all the literary Vagabonds, it is the
complexity of the man&rsquo;s temperament that attracts and
fascinates.</p>
<p>The man who can delight in the garrulous talk of a <!-- page
62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>country inn, understand the magic of big solitudes; who
can keenly appraise the points of a horse and feel the impalpable
glamour of an old ruin; who will present an impenetrable reserve
to the ordinary stranger and take the fierce, moody gypsy to his
heart; who will break almost every convention of civilization,
yet in the most unexpected way show a sturdy element of
conventionality; a man, in short, of so many bewildering
contradictions and strangely assorted qualities as Borrow cannot
but compel interest.</p>
<p>Many of the contradictory traits were not, as they seemed, the
inconsequential moods of an irresponsible nature, but may be
traced to the fierce egotism of the man.&nbsp; The Vagabond is
always an egotist; the egotism may be often amusing, and is
rarely uninteresting.&nbsp; But the personal point of view, the
personal impression, has for him the most tremendous
importance.&nbsp; It makes its possessor abnormally sensitive to
any circumstances, any environment, that may restrict his
independence or prevent the full expression of his personal
tastes and whims.&nbsp; Among our Vagabonds the two most
pronounced egotists are Borrow and Whitman.&nbsp; The secret of
their influence, their merits, and their deficiencies lies in
this intense concentration of self.&nbsp; An appreciation of this
quality leads us to comprehend a good deal of Borrow&rsquo;s
attitude towards men and women.&nbsp; Reading <i>Lavengro</i> and
<i>The Romany Rye</i> the reader is no less struck by the
remarkable interest that Borrow takes in the
people&mdash;especially the rough, uncultured people&mdash;whom
he comes across, as in the cheerful indifference with which he
loses sight of them and passes on to fresh <!-- page 63--><a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>characters.&nbsp; There is very little objective feeling
in his friendships; as flesh and blood personages with
individualities of their own&mdash;loves, hopes, faiths of their
own&mdash;he seems to regard them scarcely at all.&nbsp; They
exist chiefly as material for his curiosity and
inquisitiveness.&nbsp; Hence there is a curious selfishness about
him&mdash;not the selfishness of a passionate, capricious nature,
but the selfishness of a self-absorbed and self-contained
nature.&nbsp; Perhaps there was hidden away somewhere in his
nature a strain of tenderness, of altruistic affection, which was
reserved for a few chosen souls.&nbsp; But the warm human touch
is markedly absent from his writings, despite their undeniable
charm.</p>
<p>Take the Isopel Berners episode.&nbsp; Whether Isopel Berners
was a fiction of the imagination or a character in real life
matters not for my purpose.&nbsp; At any rate the episode, his
friendship with this Anglo-Saxon girl of the road, is one of the
distinctive features of both <i>Lavengro</i> and <i>The Romany
Rye</i>.&nbsp; The attitude of Borrow towards her may safely be
regarded as a clear indication of the man&rsquo;s character.</p>
<p>A girl of fine physical presence and many engaging qualities
such as were bound to attract a man of Borrow&rsquo;s type, who
had forsaken her friends to throw in her lot with this
fellow-wanderer on the road.&nbsp; Here were the ready elements
of a romance&mdash;of a friendship that should burn up with the
consuming power of love the baser elements of self in the
man&rsquo;s disposition, and transform his nature.</p>
<p>And what does he do?</p>
<p>He accepts her companionship, just as he might have <!-- page
64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>accepted the companionship of one of his landlords or
ostlers; spends the time he lived with her in the Dingle in
teaching her Armenian, and when at last, driven to desperation by
his calculating coldness, she comes to take farewell of him, he
makes her a perfunctory offer of marriage, which she, being a
girl of fine mettle as well as of strong affection, naturally
declines.&nbsp; She leaves him, and after a few passages of
philosophic regret, he passes on to the next adventure.</p>
<p>Now Borrow, as we know, was not physically drawn towards the
ordinary gypsy type&mdash;the dark, beautiful Celtic women; and
it was in girls of the fair Saxon order such as Isopel Berners
that he sought a natural mate.</p>
<p>Certainly, if any woman was calculated by physique and by
disposition to attract Borrow, Isopel Berners was that
woman.&nbsp; And when we find that the utmost extent of his
passion is to make tea for her and instruct her in Armenian, it
is impossible not to be disagreeably impressed by the unnatural
chilliness of such a disposition.&nbsp; Not even Isopel could
break down the barrier of intense egoism that fenced him off from
any profound intimacy with his fellow-creatures.</p>
<p>Perhaps Dr. Jessop&rsquo;s attack upon him errs in severity,
and is to an extent, as Mr. Watts-Dunton says,
&ldquo;unjust&rdquo;; but there is surely an element of truth in
his remarks when he says: &ldquo;Of anything like animal passion
there is not a trace in all his many volumes.&nbsp; Not a hint
that he ever kissed a woman or even took a little child upon his
knee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor do I think that the anecdote which Mr.
Watts-Dunton relates about the beautiful gypsy, to whom Borrow
read Arnold&rsquo;s poem, goes far to dissipate the <!-- page
65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>impression of Borrow&rsquo;s insensibility to a
woman&rsquo;s charm.</p>
<p>A passing tribute to the looks of an extraordinarily beautiful
girl is quite compatible with a comparative insensibility to
feminine beauty and feminine graces.&nbsp; That Borrow was devoid
of animal passion I do not believe&mdash;nor indeed do his books
convey that impression; that he had no feeling for beauty either
would be scarcely compatible with the Celtic element in his
nature.&nbsp; I think it less a case&mdash;as Dr. Jessop seems to
think&mdash;of want of passion as of a tyrannous egotism that
excluded any element likely to prove troublesome.&nbsp; He would
not admit a disturbing factor&mdash;such as the presence of the
self-reliant Isopel&mdash;into his life.</p>
<p>No doubt he liked Isopel well enough in his fashion.&nbsp;
Otherwise certainly he would not have made up his mind to marry
her.&nbsp; But his own feelings, his own tastes, his own fancies,
came first.&nbsp; He would marry her&mdash;oh yes!&mdash;there
was plenty of time later on.&nbsp; For the present he could study
her character, amuse himself with her idiosyncrasies, and as a
return for her devotion and faithful affection teach her
Armenian.&nbsp; Extremely touching!</p>
<p>But the episode of Isopel Berners is only one illustration,
albeit a very significant one, of Borrow&rsquo;s calculating
selfishness.&nbsp; No man could prove a more interesting
companion than he; but one cannot help feeling that he was a
sorry kind of friend.</p>
<p>It may seem strange at first sight, finding this wanderer of
the road in the pay of the Bible Society, and a zealous servant
in the cause of militant Protestantism.&nbsp; But <!-- page
66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>the
violent &ldquo;anti-Popery&rdquo; side of Borrow is only another
instance of his love of independence.&nbsp; The brooding egotism
that chafed at the least control was not likely to show any
sympathy with sacerdotalism.</p>
<p>There was no trace of philosophy in Borrow&rsquo;s frankly
expressed views on religious subjects.&nbsp; They were honest and
straightforward enough, with all the vigorous unreflective
narrowness of ultra-Protestantism.</p>
<p>It says much for the amazing charm of Borrow&rsquo;s writing
that <i>The Bible in Spain</i> is very much better than a
glorified tract.&nbsp; It must have come as a surprise to many a
grave, pious reader of the Bible Society&rsquo;s
publications.</p>
<p>And the Bible Society made the Vagabond from the literary
point of view.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s book&mdash;<i>The
Zincali</i>&mdash;or an account of the gypsies of Spain,
published in 1841, had brought his name before the public.&nbsp;
But <i>The Bible in Spain</i> (1843) made him
famous&mdash;doubtless to the relief of &ldquo;glorious John
Murray,&rdquo; the publisher, who was doubtful about the
book&rsquo;s reception.</p>
<p>It is a fascinating book, and if lacking the unique flavour of
the romantic autobiographies, <i>Lavengro</i> and <i>The Romany
Rye</i>, has none the less many of the characteristics that give
all his writings their distinctive attraction.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Can we analyse the charm that Borrow&rsquo;s books and
Borrow&rsquo;s personality exercise over us, despite the presence
of unpleasing traits which repel?</p>
<p>In the first place he had the faculty for seizing upon <!--
page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>the picturesque and picaresque elements in the world
about him.&nbsp; He had the ready instinct of the discursive
writer for what was dramatically telling.&nbsp; Present his
characters in dramatic form he could not; one and all pass
through the crucible of his temperament before we see them.&nbsp;
We feel that they are genuinely observed, but they are
Borrovized.&nbsp; They speak the language of Borrow.&nbsp; While
this is quite true, it is equally true that he knows exactly how
to impress and interest the reader with the personages.</p>
<p>Take this effective little introduction to one of the
characters in <i>The Bible in Spain</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At length the moon shone out faintly, when
suddenly by its beams I beheld a figure moving before me at a
slight distance.&nbsp; I quickened the pace of the burra, and was
soon close at its side.&nbsp; It went on, neither altering its
pace nor looking round for a moment.&nbsp; It was the figure of a
man, the tallest and bulkiest that I had hitherto seen in Spain,
dressed in a manner strange and singular for the country.&nbsp;
On his head was a hat with a low crown and broad brim, very much
resembling that of an English waggoner; about his body was a long
loose tunic or slop, seemingly of coarse ticken, open in front,
so as to allow the interior garments to be occasionally seen;
these appeared to consist of a jerkin and short velveteen
pantaloons.&nbsp; I have said that the brim of the hat was broad,
but broad as it was, it was insufficient to cover an immense bush
of coal-black hair, which, thick and curly, projected on either
side; over the left shoulder was flung a kind of satchel, and in
the right hand was held a long staff or pole.</p>
<p><!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>&ldquo;There was something peculiarly strange about the
figure, but what struck me the most was the tranquillity with
which it moved along, taking no heed of me, though, of course,
aware of my proximity, but looking straight forward along the
road, save when it occasionally raised a huge face and large eyes
towards the moon, which was now shining forth in the eastern
quarter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A cold night,&rsquo; said I at last.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Is this the way to Talavera?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is the way to Talavera, and the night is
cold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am going to Talavera,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;as
I suppose you are yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am going thither, so are you,
<i>Bueno</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tones of the voice which delivered these words were
in their way quite as strange and singular as the figure to which
the voice belonged; they were not exactly the tones of a Spanish
voice, and yet there was something in them that could hardly be
foreign; the pronunciation also was correct, and the language,
though singular, faultless.&nbsp; But I was most struck with the
manner in which the last word, <i>bueno</i>, was spoken.&nbsp; I
had heard something like it before, but where or when I could by
no means remember.&nbsp; A pause now ensued; the figure stalking
on as before with the most perfect indifference, and seemingly
with no disposition either to seek or avoid conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Are you not afraid,&rsquo; said I at last,
&lsquo;to travel these roads in the dark?&nbsp; It is said that
there are robbers abroad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Are you not rather afraid,&rsquo; replied the
figure, &lsquo;to <!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>travel these roads in the
dark&mdash;you who are ignorant of the country, who are a
foreigner, an Englishman!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How is it that you know me to be an
Englishman?&rsquo; demanded I, much surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That is no difficult matter,&rsquo; replied the
figure; &lsquo;the sound of your voice was enough to tell me
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You speak of voices,&rsquo; said I;
&lsquo;suppose the tone of your own voice were to tell me who you
are?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That it will not do,&rsquo; replied my
companion; &lsquo;you know nothing about me&mdash;you can know
nothing about me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Be not sure of that, my friend; I am acquainted
with many things of which you have little idea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Por exemplo,&rsquo; said the figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;For example,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you speak two
languages.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The figure moved on, seemed to consider a moment, and
then said slowly, &lsquo;<i>Bueno</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You have two names,&rsquo; I continued;
&lsquo;one for the house and the other for the street; both are
good, but the one by which you are called at home is the one
which you like best.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man walked on about ten paces, in the same manner
as he had previously done; all of a sudden he turned, and taking
the bridle of the burra gently in his hand, stopped her.&nbsp; I
had now a full view of his face and figure, and those huge
features and Herculean form still occasionally revisit me in my
dreams.&nbsp; I see him standing in the moonshine, staring me in
the face with his deep calm eyes.&nbsp; At last he
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Are you then one of us?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An admirable sketch, adroitly conceived and executed <!-- page
70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>beyond doubt, but as a fragment of dialogue remarkable
for its literary skill rather than for its characterization.</p>
<p>His instinct for the picturesque never fails him.&nbsp; This
is one of the reasons why, despite his astounding garrulousness,
the readers of his books are never wearied.</p>
<p>Whether it be a ride in the forest, a tramp on foot, an
interview with some individual who has interested him, the
picturesque side is always presented, and never is he at better
advantage than when depicting some scene of gypsy life.</p>
<p>Opening <i>The Bible in Spain</i> at random I happen on this
description of a gypsy supper.&nbsp; It is certainly not one of
the best or most picturesque, but as an average sample of his
scenic skill it will serve its purpose well.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hour succeeded hour, and still we sat
crouching over the brasero, from which, by this time, all warmth
had departed; the glow had long since disappeared, and only a few
dying sparks were to be distinguished.&nbsp; The room or hall was
now involved in utter darkness; the women were motionless and
still; I shivered and began to feel uneasy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Will
Antonio be here to-night?&rsquo; at length I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>No tenga usted cuidao</i>, my London
Caloro,&rsquo; said the gypsy mother, in an unearthly tone;
&lsquo;Pepindorio <a name="citation70"></a><a href="#footnote70"
class="citation">[70]</a> has been here some time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was about to rise from my seat and attempt to escape
from the house, when I felt a hand laid upon my shoulder, and in
a moment I heard the voice of Antonio.</p>
<p><!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Be not afraid, &rsquo;tis I, brother; we
will have a light anon, and then supper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The supper was rude enough, consisting of bread,
cheese, and olive.&nbsp; Antonio, however, produced a leathern
bottle of excellent wine; we dispatched these viands by the light
of an earthern lamp which was placed upon the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Antonio to the youngest female,
&lsquo;bring me the pajandi, and I will sing a
gachapla.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl brought the guitar, which with some difficulty
the gypsy tuned, and then, strumming it vigorously, he
sang&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stole a plump and bonny fowl,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But ere I well had dined,<br />
The master came with scowl and growl,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And me would captive bind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My hat and mantle off I threw,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And scour&rsquo;d across the lea,<br />
Then cried the beng <a name="citation71"></a><a
href="#footnote71" class="citation">[71]</a> with loud halloo,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where does the Gypsy flee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He continued playing and singing for a considerable
time, the two younger females dancing in the meanwhile with
unwearied diligence, whilst the aged mother occasionally snapped
her fingers or beat time on the ground with her stock.&nbsp; At
last Antonio suddenly laid down the instrument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I see the London Caloro is weary.&nbsp; Enough,
enough; to-morrow more thereof&mdash;we will now to the
<i>charip&eacute;</i>&rsquo; (bed).</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;With all my heart,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;where
are we to sleep?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;In the stable,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;in
the manger; however cold the stable may be, we shall be warm
enough in the bufa.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps his power in this direction is more fully appreciated
when he deals with material that promises no such wealth of
colour as do gypsy scenes and wanderings in the romantic
South.</p>
<p>Cheapside and London Bridge suit him fully as well as do
Spanish forests or Welsh mountains.&nbsp; True romancer as he is,
he is not dependent on conventionally picturesque externals for
arresting attention; since he will discover the stuff of
adventure wherever his steps may lead him.&nbsp; The streets of
Bagdad in the &ldquo;golden prime&rdquo; of Haroun Alraschid are
no more mysterious, more enthralling, than the well-known
thoroughfares of modern London.&nbsp; No ancient sorceress of
Eastern story can touch his imagination more deeply than can an
old gypsy woman.&nbsp; A skirmish with a publisher is fully as
exciting as a tilt in a medieval tourney; while the stories told
him by a rural landlord promise as much relish as any of the
tales recounted by Oriental barbers and one-eyed Calenders.</p>
<p>Thus it is that while the pervasive egotism of the man
bewitches us, we yield readily to the spell of his splendid
garrulity.&nbsp; It is of no great moment that he should take an
occasional drink to quench his thirst when passing along the
London streets.&nbsp; But he will continue to make even these
little details interesting.&nbsp; Did he think fit to recount a
sneeze, or to discourse upon the occasion on which he brushed his
hair, he would none the less, I think, have held the
reader&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p><!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>Here is the episode of a chance drink; it is a drink and
nothing more; but it is not meant to be skipped, and does not
deserve to be overlooked.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Notwithstanding the excellence of the
London pavement, I began, about nine o&rsquo;clock, to feel
myself thoroughly tired; painfully and slowly did I drag my feet
along.&nbsp; I also felt very much in want of some refreshment,
and I remembered that since breakfast I had taken nothing.&nbsp;
I was in the Strand, and glancing about I perceived that I was
close by an hotel which bore over the door the somewhat
remarkable name of &lsquo;Holy Lands.&rsquo;&nbsp; Without a
moment&rsquo;s hesitation I entered a well-lighted passage, and
turning to the left I found myself in a well-lighted coffee-room,
with a well-dressed and frizzled waiter before me.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Bring me some claret,&rsquo; said I, for I was rather
faint than hungry, and I felt ashamed to give a humble order to
so well-dressed an individual.&nbsp; The waiter looked at me for
a moment, then making a low bow he bustled off, and I sat myself
down in the box nearest to the window.&nbsp; Presently the waiter
returned, bearing beneath his left arm a long bottle, and between
the fingers of his right hand two purple glasses; placing the
latter on the table, set the bottle down before me with a bang,
and then standing still appeared to watch my movements.&nbsp; You
think I don&rsquo;t know how to drink a glass of claret, thought
I to myself.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll soon show you how we drink claret
where I come from; and filling one of the glasses to the brim, I
flickered it for a moment between my eyes and the lustre, and
then held it to my nose; having given that organ full time to
test the bouquet of <!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>the wine, I applied the glass to my
lips.&nbsp; Taking a large mouthful of the wine, which I
swallowed slowly and by degrees that the palate might likewise
have an opportunity of performing its functions.&nbsp; A second
mouthful I disposed of more summarily; then placing the empty
glass upon the table, I fixed my eyes upon the bottle and said
nothing; whereupon the waiter who had been observing the whole
process with considerable attention, made me a bow yet more low
than before, and turning on his heel retired with a smart chuck
of the head, as much as to say, &lsquo;It is all right; the young
man is used to claret.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A slight enough incident, but, like every line which Borrow
wrote, intensely temperamental.&nbsp; How characteristic this of
the man&rsquo;s attitude: &ldquo;You think I don&rsquo;t know how
to drink a glass of claret, thought I to myself.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then with what deliberate pleasure does he record the theatrical
posing for the benefit of the waiter.&nbsp; How he loves to
impress!&nbsp; You are conscious of this in every scene which he
describes, and it is quite useless to resent it.&nbsp; The only
way to escape it is by leaving Borrow unread.&nbsp; And this no
wise man can do willingly.</p>
<p>The insatiable thirst for adventure, the passion for the
picturesque and dramatic, were so constant with him, that it need
not surprise us when he seizes upon every opportunity for
mystifying and exciting interest.&nbsp; It is possible that the
&ldquo;veiled period&rdquo; in his life about which he hints is
veiled because it was a time of privation and suffering, and he
is consequently anxious to forget it.&nbsp; But I do not think it
likely.&nbsp; Nor do the remarks of <!-- page 75--><a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>Mr.
Watts-Dunton on this subject support this theory.&nbsp; Indeed,
Mr. Watts-Dunton, who knew him so intimately, and had ample
occasion to note his love of &ldquo;making a mystery,&rdquo;
hints pretty plainly that &ldquo;the veiled period&rdquo; may
well be a pleasant myth invented by Borrow just for the
excitement of it, not because there was anything special to
conceal, or because he wished to regard certain chapters in his
life as a closed book.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>Mention has been made of Borrow&rsquo;s feeling for the
picaresque elements in life.&nbsp; Give him a rogue, a wastrel,
any character with a touch of the untamed about him, and no one
delighted him more in exhibiting the fascinating points of this
character and his own power in attracting these rough, unsocial
fellows towards him and eliciting their confidences.&nbsp;
Failing the genuine article, however, Borrow had quite as
remarkable a knack of giving even for conventional people and
highly respectable thoroughfares a roguish and adventurous
air.&nbsp; Indeed it was this sympathy with the picaresque side
of life, this thorough understanding of the gypsy temperament,
that gives Borrow&rsquo;s genius its unique distinction.&nbsp;
Other characteristics, though important, are subsidiary to
this.&nbsp; Writers such as Stevenson have given us discursive
books of travel; other Vagabonds have shown an equal zest for the
life of the open air&mdash;Thoreau and Whitman, for
example.&nbsp; But contact with the gypsies revealed Borrow to
himself, made him aware <!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>of his powers.&nbsp; It is not so
much a case of like seeking like, as of like seeking
unlike.&nbsp; Affinities there were, no doubt, between the Romany
and the &ldquo;Gorgio&rdquo; Borrow, but they are strong
temperamental differences.&nbsp; On the one side an easy,
unconscious nonchalance, a natural vivacity; on the other a
morbid self-consciousness and a pronounced strain of
melancholy.&nbsp; And it was doubtless the contrast that appealed
to him so strongly and helped him to throw off his habitual moody
reserve.</p>
<p>For beneath that unpromising reserve, as a few chosen friends
knew, and as the gypsies knew, there was a frank camaraderie that
won their hearts.</p>
<p>Was he, one naturally asks, when once this barrier of reserve
had been broken down, a lovable man?&nbsp; Certainly he seems to
have won the affection of the gypsies; and the warm admiration of
men like Mr. Watts-Dunton points to an affirmative answer.&nbsp;
And yet one hesitates.&nbsp; He attracted people, that cannot be
gainsaid; he won many affections, that also is
uncontrovertible.&nbsp; But to call a man lovable it is not
sufficient that he should win affection, he must retain it.&nbsp;
Was Borrow able to do this?&nbsp; There is the famous case of
Isopel to answer in the negative.&nbsp; She loved him, but she
found him out.&nbsp; Was it not so?&nbsp; How else explain the
gradual change of demeanour, and the sad, disillusioned
departure.&nbsp; Perhaps at first the independence of the man,
his freedom from sentimentality, piqued, interested, and
attracted her.&nbsp; This is often the case with women.&nbsp;
They may fall in love with an unsentimental man, but they can
never be happy with him.</p>
<p><!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>Isopel retained a regard for her fellow-comrade of the
road, but she would not be his wife.</p>
<p>Of his literary friends no one has written so warmly in
defence of Borrow, or shown a more discerning admiration of his
qualities than Mr. Watts-Dunton.</p>
<p>And yet in the warm tribute which Mr. Watts-Dunton has paid to
Borrow I cannot help feeling that some of the illustrations he
gives in justification of his eulogy are scarcely adequate.&nbsp;
It may well be that he has a wealth of personal reminiscences
which he could quote if so inclined, and make good his
asseverations.&nbsp; As it is, one can judge only by what he
tells us.&nbsp; And what does he tell us?</p>
<p>To show that Borrow took an interest in children, Mr.
Watts-Dunton quotes a story about Borrow and the gipsy child
which &ldquo;Borrow was fond of telling in support of his
anti-tobacco bias.&rdquo;&nbsp; The point of the story lies in
the endeavours of Borrow to dissuade a gypsy woman from smoking
her pipe, whilst his friend pointed out to the woman how the
smoke was injuring the child whom she was suckling.&nbsp; Borrow
used his friend&rsquo;s argument, which obviously appealed to the
maternal instinct in order to persuade the woman to give up her
pipe.&nbsp; There is no reason to think that Borrow was
especially concerned for the child&rsquo;s welfare.&nbsp; What
concerned him was a human being poisoning herself with nicotine,
and his dislike particularly to see a woman smoking.&nbsp; After
the woman had gone he said to his friend: &ldquo;It ought to be a
criminal offence for a woman to smoke at all.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
that it was frankly as an anti-tobacco crusader that he
considered the episode, is proved surely by Mr. Watts-Dunton <!--
page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>himself, when he adds: &ldquo;Whenever he (Borrow) was
told, as he sometimes was, that what brought on the
&lsquo;horrors&rsquo; when he lived alone in the Dingle, was the
want of tobacco, this story was certain to come up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One cannot accept this as a specially striking instance of
Borrow&rsquo;s interest in children, any more than the passing
reference (already noted) to the extraordinarily beautiful gypsy
girl, as an instance of his susceptibility to feminine
charms.</p>
<p>Failing better illustrations at first hand, one turns toward
his books, where he reveals so many characteristics, and here one
is struck by the want of susceptibility, the obvious lack of
interest in the other sex, showed by his few references to women,
and what is even more significant the absence of any love story
in his own life, apart from his books (his marriage with the
well-to-do widow, though a happy one, can scarcely be called
romantic).&nbsp; These things certainly outweigh the trivial
incident which Mr. Watts-Dunton recalls.</p>
<p>As for the pipe episode, it reminds me of Macaulay&rsquo;s
well-known gibe at the Puritans, who objected to bear-baiting, he
says, less because it gave pain to the bear than because it gave
pleasure to the spectators.&nbsp; Similarly his objection to the
pipe seems not so much on account of the child suffering, as
because the woman took pleasure in this &ldquo;pernicious
habit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But enough of fault-finding.&nbsp; After all, Mr. Watts-Dunton
has done a signal service to literature by preferring the claims
of Borrow, and has upheld him loyally against attacks which were
too frequently mean-spirited and unfair.</p>
<p><!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>Obviously, Borrow was a man of an ingratiating
personality, which is a very different thing from saying that he
was a man with an ingratiating manner.&nbsp; Of all manners, the
ingratiating is the one most likely to arouse suspicion in the
minds of all but the most obtuse.&nbsp; An ingratiating
personality, however, is one that without effort and in the
simplest way attracts others, as a magnet attracts iron.&nbsp;
Once get Borrow interested in a man, it followed quite naturally
that the man was interested in Borrow.&nbsp; He might be a rough,
unsociable fellow with whom others found it hard to get on, but
Borrow would win his confidence in a few moments.</p>
<p>Borrow seemed to know exactly how to approach people, what to
say, and how to say it.&nbsp; Sometimes he may have preferred to
stand aloof in moody reserve; that is another matter.&nbsp; But
given the inclination, he had a genius for companionship, as some
men have a genius for friendship.&nbsp; As a rule it will be
found that the Vagabond, the Wanderer, is far better as a
companion than as friend.&nbsp; What he cares for is to smile,
chatter, and pass on.&nbsp; Loyal he may be to those who have
done him service, but he is not ready to encroach upon his own
comfort and convenience for any man.&nbsp; Borrow remained
steadfast to his friends, but a personal slight, even if not
intended, he regarded as unforgivable.</p>
<p>The late Dr. Martineau was at school with him at Norwich, and
after a youthful escapade on Borrow&rsquo;s part, Martineau was
selected by the master as the boy to &ldquo;horse&rdquo; Borrow
while he was undergoing corporal punishment.&nbsp; Probably the
proceeding was quite as distasteful to the young Martineau as to
the scapegrace.&nbsp; <!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>But Borrow never forgot the incident
nor forgave the compulsory participator in his degradation.&nbsp;
And years afterwards he declined to attend a social function when
he had ascertained that Martineau would be there, making a point
of deliberately avoiding him.&nbsp; Another instance this of the
morbid egotism of the man.</p>
<p>Where, however, no whim or caprice stood in the way, Borrow
reminds one of the man who knows as soon as he has tapped the
earth with the &ldquo;divining rod&rdquo; whether or no there is
water there.&nbsp; Directly he saw a man he could tell by
instinct whether there was stuff of interest there; and he knew
how to elicit it.&nbsp; And never is he more successful than when
dealing with the &ldquo;powerful, uneducated man.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Consequently, no portion of his writings are more fascinating
than when he has to deal with such figures.&nbsp; Who can forget
his delightful pictures of the gypsy&mdash;&ldquo;Mr.
Petulengro&rdquo;?&nbsp; Especially the famous meeting in
<i>Lavengro</i>, when he and the narrator discourse on death.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Life is sweet, brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you think so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Think so!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s night and day,
brother, both sweet things; sun, moon, and stars, brother, all
sweet things; there&rsquo;s likewise a wind on the heath.&nbsp;
Life is very sweet, brother.&nbsp; Who would wish to
die?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I would wish to die.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You talk like a Gorgio&mdash;which is the same
as talking like a fool&mdash;were you a Romany chal you would
talk wiser.&nbsp; Wish to die indeed!&nbsp; A Romany chal would
wish to live for ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;In sickness, Jasper?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s the sun and stars,
brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In blindness, Jasper?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s the wind on the heath, brother; if
I could only feel that, I would gladly live for ever.&nbsp;
Dosta, we&rsquo;ll now go to the tents and put on the gloves; and
I&rsquo;ll try to make you feel what a sweet thing it is to be
alive.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then again there is the inimitable ostler in <i>The Romany
Rye</i>, whose talk exhales what Borrow would call &ldquo;the
wholesome smell of the stable.&rdquo;&nbsp; His wonderful
harangues (Borrovized to a less extent than usual) have all the
fine, breathless garrulity of this breed of man, and his unique
discourse on &ldquo;how to manage a horse on a journey&rdquo;
occupies a delightful chapter.&nbsp; Here are the opening
sentences:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When you are a gentleman,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;should you ever wish to take a journey on a horse
of your own, and you could not have a much better than the one
you have here eating its fill in the box yonder&mdash;I wonder,
by the by, how you ever came by it&mdash;you can&rsquo;t do
better than follow the advice I am about to give you, both with
respect to your animal and yourself.&nbsp; Before you start,
merely give your horse a couple of handfuls of corn and a little
water, somewhat under a quart, and if you drink a pint of water
yourself out of the pail, you will feel all the better during the
whole day; then you may walk and trot your animal for about ten
miles, till you come to some nice inn, where you may get down,
and see your horse led into a nice stall, telling him not to feed
him till you come.&nbsp; If the ostler happens to be a
dog-fancier, and has an <!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>English terrier dog like that of mine
there, say what a nice dog it is, and praise its black and fawn;
and if he does not happen to be a dog-fancier, ask him how
he&rsquo;s getting on, and whether he ever knew worse times; that
kind of thing will please the ostler, and he will let you do just
what you please with your own horse, and when your back is turned
he&rsquo;ll say to his comrades what a nice gentleman you are,
and how he thinks he has seen you before; then go and sit down to
breakfast, get up and go and give your horse a feed of corn; chat
with the ostler two or three minutes till your horse has taken
the shine out of his oats, which will prevent the ostler taking
any of it away when your back is turned, for such things are
sometimes done&mdash;not that I ever did such a thing myself when
I was at the inn at Hounslow; oh, dear me, no!&nbsp; Then go and
finish your breakfast.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>It is interesting to compare Borrow&rsquo;s studies in
unvarnished human nature with the characterizations of novelists
like Mr. Thomas Hardy.&nbsp; Both Borrow and Hardy are drawn
especially to rough primal characters, characters not
&ldquo;screened by conventions.&rdquo;&nbsp; As Mr. Hardy puts it
in an essay contributed to the <i>Forum</i> in 1888.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The conduct of the upper classes is
screened by conventions, and thus the real character is not
easily seen; if it is seen it must be pourtrayed subjectively,
whereas in the lower walks conduct is a direct expression <!--
page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>of the inner life, and their characters can be directly
pourtrayed through the act.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Hardy&rsquo;s rustics differ from Borrow&rsquo;s rustics,
however, in the method of presentment.&nbsp; Mr. Hardy is always
the sympathetic, amused observer.&nbsp; The reader of that
delicious pastoral &ldquo;Under the Greenwood Tree&rdquo; feels
that he is listening to a man who is recounting something he has
overheard.&nbsp; The account is finely sympathetic, but there is
an unmistakable note of philosophic detachment.&nbsp; The
story-teller has enjoyed his company, but is obviously not of
them.&nbsp; That is why he will gossip to you with such relish of
humour.&nbsp; Borrow, on the other hand, speaks as one of
them.&nbsp; He is far less amused by his garrulous ostlers and
whimsical landlords than profoundly interested in them.&nbsp;
Then again, though the Vagabond type appeals to Mr. Hardy, it
appeals to him not because of any temperamental affinity, but
because he happens to be a curious, wistful spectator of human
life.&nbsp; He sees in the restless Vagabond an extreme example
of the capricious sport of fate, but while his heart goes out to
him his mind stands aloof.</p>
<p>Looking at their characterization from the literary point of
view, it is evident that Mr. Hardy is the greater realist.&nbsp;
He would give you <i>an</i> ostler, whereas Borrow gives you
<i>the</i> ostler.&nbsp; Borrow knows his man thoroughly, but he
will not trouble about little touches of individualization.&nbsp;
We see the ostler vividly&mdash;we do not see the man&mdash;save
on the ostler side.&nbsp; With Hardy we should see other aspects
beside the ostler aspect of the man.</p>
<p><!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>A novelist with whom Borrow has greater affinity is
Charles Reade.&nbsp; There is the same quick, observant,
unphilosophical spirit; the same preference for plain, simple
folk, the same love of health and virility.&nbsp; And in <i>The
Cloister and the Hearth</i>, one of the great romances of the
world, one feels touches of the same Vagabond spirit as animates
<i>Lavengro</i> and <i>The Romany Rye</i>.&nbsp; The incomparable
Denys, with his favourite cry, &ldquo;Le diable est mort,&rdquo;
is a splendid study in genial vagrancy.</p>
<p>Literary comparisons, though they discover affinities, but
serve to emphasize in the long run the distinctive originality of
Borrow&rsquo;s writings.</p>
<p>He has himself admitted to the influence of Defoe and
Lesage.&nbsp; But though his manner recalls at times the manner
of Defoe, and though the form of his narrative reminds the reader
of the Spanish rogue story, the psychological atmosphere is
vastly different.&nbsp; He may have taken Defoe as his model just
as Thackeray took Fielding; but <i>Vanity Fair</i> is not more
unlike <i>Tom Jones</i> than is <i>Lavengro</i> unlike
<i>Robinson Crusoe</i>.</p>
<p>It is idle to seek for the literary parentage of this
Vagabond.&nbsp; Better far to accept him as he is, a wanderer, a
rover, a curious taster of life, at once a mystic and a
realist.&nbsp; He may have qualities that repel; but so full is
he of contradictions that no sooner has the frown settled on the
brow than it gives place to a smile.&nbsp; We may not always like
him; never can we ignore him.&nbsp; Provocative, unsatisfying,
fascinating&mdash;such is George Borrow.&nbsp; And most
fascinating of all is his love of night, day, sun, moon, and
stars, &ldquo;all sweet things.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cribbed in the close
and dusty purlieus of the city, <!-- page 85--><a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>wearied by
the mechanical monotony of the latest fashionable novel, we
respond gladly to the spacious freshness of <i>Lavengro</i> and
<i>The Romany Rye</i>.&nbsp; Herein lies the spell of Borrow; for
in his company there is always &ldquo;a wind on the
heath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thoreau has suffered badly at the hands of the critics.&nbsp;
By some he has been regarded as a poser, and the Walden episode
has been spoken of as a mere theatrical trick.&nbsp; By others he
has been derided as a cold-blooded hermit, who fled from
civilization and the intercourse of his fellows.&nbsp; Even Mr.
Watts-Dunton, the eloquent friend of the Children of the Open
Air, quite recently in his introduction to an edition of
<i>Walden</i> has impugned his sincerity, and leaves the
impression that Thoreau was an uncomfortable kind of
egotist.&nbsp; He has not lacked friends, but his friends have
not always written discreetly about him, thus giving the enemy
opportunity to blaspheme.&nbsp; And while not unmindful of Mr. H.
S. Salt&rsquo;s sympathetic biography, nor the admirable
monograph by Mr. &ldquo;H. A. Page,&rdquo; there is no denying
the fact that the trend of modern criticism has been against
him.&nbsp; The sarcastic comments of J. R. Lowell, and the banter
of R. L. Stevenson, however we may disagree with them, are not to
be lightly ignored, coming from critics usually so sane and
discerning.</p>
<p>Since it is the Walden episode, the two years&rsquo; sojourn
in the woods near Concord, that has provoked the scornful <!--
page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>ire of the critics, it may be well to re-examine that
incident.</p>
<p>From his earliest years Thoreau was a lover of the open
air.&nbsp; It was not merely a poetic appreciation such as
Emerson had of the beauties of nature&mdash;though a genuine
poetic imagination coloured all that he wrote&mdash;but an
intellectual enthusiasm for the wonders of the natural world,
and, most important of all, a deep and tender sympathy with all
created things characteristic of the Eastern rather than the
Western mind.&nbsp; He observed as a naturalist, admired like a
poet, loved with the fervour of a Buddhist; every faculty of his
nature did homage to the Earth.</p>
<p>Most of us will admit to a sentimental regard for the open air
and for country sights and sounds.&nbsp; But in many cases it
reduces itself to a vague liking for &ldquo;pretty scenery&rdquo;
and an annual conviction that a change of air will do us
good.&nbsp; And so it is that the man who prefers to live the
greater part of his life in the open is looked upon either as a
crank or a poser.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s taste for adventure, and
the picturesque vigour of his personality, help largely in our
minds to condone his wandering instinct.&nbsp; But the more
passive temperament of Thoreau, and the absence in his writings
of any stuff of romance, lead us to feel a kind of puzzled
contempt for the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shirks his duty as a citizen,&rdquo; says the
practical Englishman; &ldquo;He experienced nothing worth
mentioning,&rdquo; says the lover of adventure.&nbsp; Certainly
he lacked many of the qualities that make the literary Vagabond
attractive&mdash;and for this reason many will deny him the <!--
page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>right to a place among them&mdash;but he was neither a
skulker nor a hermit.</p>
<p>In 1839, soon after leaving college, he made his first long
jaunt in company with his brother John.&nbsp; This was a voyage
on the Concord and Merrimac rivers&mdash;a pleasant piece of
idling turned to excellent literary account.&nbsp; The volume
dealing with it&mdash;his first book&mdash;gives sufficient
illustration of his practical powers to dissipate the absurd
notion that he was a mere sentimentalist.&nbsp; No literary
Vagabond was ever more skilful with his hands than Thoreau.&nbsp;
There was scarcely anything he could not do, from making lead
pencils to constructing a boat.&nbsp; And throughout his life he
supported himself by manual labour whenever occasion
demanded.&nbsp; Had he been so disposed he could doubtless have
made a fortune&mdash;for he had all the nimble versatility of the
American character, and much of its shrewdness.&nbsp; His
attacks, therefore, upon money-making, and upon the evils of
civilization, are no mere vapourings of an incompetent, but the
honest conviction of a man who believes he has chosen the better
part.</p>
<p>In his <i>Walk to Wachusett</i> there are touches of genial
friendliness with the simple, sincere country folk, and evidence
that he was heartily welcome by them.&nbsp; Such a welcome would
not have been vouchsafed to a cold-blooded recluse.</p>
<p>The keen enjoyment afforded to mind and body by these outings
suggested to Thoreau the desirability of a longer and more
intimate association with Nature.&nbsp; Walden Wood had been a
familiar and favoured spot for many years, and so he began the
building of his <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>tabernacle there.&nbsp; So far from
being a sudden, sensational resolve with an eye to effect, it was
the natural outcome of his passion for the open.</p>
<p>He had his living to earn, and would go down into Concord from
time to time to sell the results of his handiwork.&nbsp; He was
quite willing to see friends and any chance travellers who
visited from other motives than mere inquisitiveness.&nbsp; On
the other hand, the life he proposed for himself as a temporary
experiment would afford many hours of congenial solitude, when he
could study the ways of the animals that he loved and give free
expression to his naturalistic enthusiasms.</p>
<p>Far too much has been made of the Walden episode.&nbsp; It has
been written upon as if it had represented the totality of
Thoreau&rsquo;s life, instead of being merely an interesting
episode.&nbsp; Critics have animadverted upon it, as if the time
had been spent in brooding, self-pity, and sentimental
affectations, as if Thoreau had gone there to escape from his
fellow-men.&nbsp; All this seems to me wide of the mark.&nbsp;
Thoreau was always keenly interested in men and manners; his
essays abound in a practical sagacity, too frequently
overlooked.&nbsp; He went to Walden not to escape from ordinary
life, but to fit himself for ordinary life.&nbsp; The sylvan
solitudes, as he knew, had their lessons for him no less than the
busy haunts of men.</p>
<p>Of course it would be idle to deny that he found his greatest
happiness in the woods and fields; it is this touch of wildness
that makes of him a Vagabond.&nbsp; But though not an emotional
man, his was not a hard nature so much as a reserved,
self-centred nature, rarely <!-- page 93--><a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>expressing
itself in outward show of feeling.&nbsp; That he was a man
capable of strong affection is shown by his devotion to his
brother.&nbsp; Peculiarities of temperament he had certainly,
idiosyncrasies as marked as those of Borrow.&nbsp; These I wish
to discuss later.&nbsp; For the moment I am concerned to defend
him from the criticism that he was a loveless, brooding kind of
creature, more interested in birds and fishes than in his
fellow-men.&nbsp; For he was neither loveless nor brooding, and
the characteristics that have proved most puzzling arose from the
mingled strain in his nature of the Eastern quietist and the
shrewd Western.&nbsp; These may now be considered more
leisurely.&nbsp; I will deal with the less important first of
all.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Some of his earlier work suffers somewhat from a too faithful
discipleship of Emerson; but when he had found himself, as he has
in <i>Walden</i>, he can break away from this tendency, and there
are many lovely passages untouched by didacticism.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The stillness was intense and almost
conscious, as if it were a natural sabbath.&nbsp; The air was so
elastic and crystalline that it had the same effect on the
landscape that a glass has on a picture&mdash;to give it an ideal
remoteness and perfection.&nbsp; The landscape was bathed in a
mild and quiet light, while the woods and fences chequered and
partitioned it with new regularity, and rough and uneven fields
stretched far away with lawnlike <!-- page 94--><a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>smoothness to
the horizon, and the clouds, finely distinct and picturesque,
seemed a fit drapery to hang over fairyland.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But while there is the Wordsworthian appreciation of the
peaceful moods of Nature and of the gracious stillnesses, there
is the true spirit of the Vagabond in his Earth-worship.&nbsp;
Witness his pleasant &ldquo;Essay on Walking&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We are but faint-hearted crusaders; even
the walkers nowadays undertake no persevering world&rsquo;s end
enterprises.&nbsp; Our expeditions are but tours, and come round
again at evening to the old hearthside from which we set
out.&nbsp; Half of the walk is but retracing our steps.&nbsp; We
should go forth on the shortest walks, perchance, in the spirit
of stirring adventure, never to return, prepared to send back our
embalmed hearts only as relics to our desolate kingdom.&nbsp; If
you have paid your debts and made your will and settled all your
affairs, and are a free man, then you are ready for a
walk.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a relish in this sprightly abjuration that is
transmittible to all but the dullest mind.&nbsp; The essay can
take its place beside Hazlitt&rsquo;s &ldquo;On Going a
Journey,&rdquo; than which we can give it no higher praise.</p>
<p>With all his appreciation of the quieter, the gentler aspects
of nature, he has the true hardiness of the child of the road,
and has as cheery a welcome for the east wind as he has for the
gentlest of summer breezes.&nbsp; Here is a little winter&rsquo;s
sketch:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The wonderful purity of Nature at this
season is a most pleasing fact.&nbsp; Every decayed stump and
moss-grown stone and rush of the dead leaves of autumn are <!--
page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>concealed by a clean napkin of snow.&nbsp; In the bare
fields and trickling woods see what virtue survives.&nbsp; In the
coldest and bleakest places the warmest charities still maintain
a foothold.&nbsp; A cold and searching wind drives away all
contagion, and nothing can withstand it but what has a virtue in
it; and accordingly whatever we meet with in cold and bleak
places as the tops of mountains, we respect for a sort of sturdy
innocence, a Puritan toughness.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Thoreau&rsquo;s pleasant gossips about the woods in Maine,
or on the Concord River, would pall after a time were they not
interspersed with larger utterances and with suggestive
illustrations from the Books of the East.&nbsp; Merely considered
as &ldquo;poet-naturalist&rdquo; he cannot rank with Gilbert
White for quaint simplicity, nor have his discursive essays the
full, rich note that we find in Richard Jefferies.&nbsp; That his
writings show a sensitive imagination as well as a quick
observation the above extracts will show.&nbsp; But unfortunately
he had contracted a bad attack of Emersonitis, from which as
literary writer he never completely recovered.&nbsp; Salutary as
Emerson was to Thoreau as an intellectual irritant, he was the
last man in the world for the discursive Thoreau to take as a
literary model.</p>
<p>Many fine passages in his writings are spoiled by vocal
imitations of the &ldquo;voice oracular,&rdquo; which is the more
annoying inasmuch as Thoreau was no weak replica of Emerson
intellectually, showing in some respects indeed a firmer grasp of
the realities of life.&nbsp; But for some reason or other he grew
enamoured of certain Emersonian mannerisms, which he used
whenever he felt inclined <!-- page 96--><a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>to fire off a
platitude.&nbsp; Sometimes he does it so well that it is hard to
distinguish the disciple from his master.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;How can we expect a harvest of thought who
have not a seedtime of character?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Only he can be trusted with goods who can
present a face of bronze to expectations.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unimpeachable in sentiment, but too obviously inspired for us
to view them with satisfaction.&nbsp; And Thoreau at his best is
so fresh, so original, that we decline to be put off with
literary imitations, however excellently done.</p>
<p>And thus it is that Thoreau has been too often regarded as a
mere disciple of Emerson.&nbsp; For this he cannot altogether
escape blame, but the student will soon detect the superficiality
of the criticism, and see the genuine Thoreau beneath the
Emersonian veneer.</p>
<p>Thoreau lacked the integrating genius of Emerson, on the one
hand, yet possessed an eye for concrete facts which the master
certainly lacked.&nbsp; His strength, therefore, lay in another
direction, and where Thoreau is seen at his best is where he is
dealing with the concrete experiences of life, illustrating them
from his wide and discursive knowledge of Indian character and
Oriental modes of thought.</p>
<h3><!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>III</h3>
<p>Insufficient attention has been paid, I think, to
Thoreau&rsquo;s sympathy with the Indian character and his
knowledge of their ways.</p>
<p>The Indians were to Thoreau what the gypsies were to
Borrow.&nbsp; Appealing to certain spiritual affinities in the
men&rsquo;s natures, they revealed their own temperaments to
them, enabling them to see the distinctiveness of their
powers.&nbsp; Thoreau was never quite able to give this intimate
knowledge such happy literary expression as Borrow.&nbsp;
Apprehending the peculiar charm, the power and limitations of the
Indian character, appreciating its philosophical value, he lacked
the picturesque pen of Borrow to visualize this for the
reader.</p>
<p>A lover of Indian relics from his childhood, he followed the
Indians into their haunts, and conversed with them
frequently.&nbsp; Some of the most interesting passages he has
written detail conversations with them.&nbsp; One feels he knew
and understood them; and they no less understood him, and talked
with him as they certainly would not have done with any other
white man.&nbsp; But one would have liked to have heard much more
about them.&nbsp; If only Thoreau could have given us an Indian
Petulengro, how interesting it would have been!</p>
<p>But, like the Indian, there was a reserve and impenetrability
about Thoreau which prevented him from ever becoming really
confidential in print.&nbsp; If he had but unbended more
frequently, and not sifted his thought <!-- page 98--><a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>so
conscientiously before he gave us the benefit of it, he would
certainly have appealed to our affections far more than he
does.</p>
<p>One feels in comparing his writings with the accounts of him
by friends how much that was interesting in the man remains
unexpressed in terms of literature.&nbsp; Partly this is due, no
doubt, to his being tormented with the idea of self-education
that he had learnt from Emerson.&nbsp; In a philosopher and
moralist self-education is all very well.&nbsp; But in a
naturalist and in a writer with so much of the Vagabond about him
as Thoreau this sensitiveness about self-culture, this anxiety to
eliminate all the temperamental tares, is blameworthy.</p>
<p>The care he took to eliminate the lighter element in his
work&mdash;the flash of wit, the jocose aside&mdash;a care which
pursued him to the last, seems to show that he too often mistook
gravity for seriousness.&nbsp; Like Dr. Watts&rsquo; bee (which
is not Maeterlinck&rsquo;s) he &ldquo;improved the shining
hour,&rdquo; instead of allowing the shining hour to carry with
it its own improvement, none the less potent for being
unformulated.&nbsp; But beside the Emersonian influence, there is
the Puritan strain in Thoreau&rsquo;s nature, which must not be
overlooked.&nbsp; No doubt it also is partly accountable for his
literary silences and austere moods.</p>
<p>To revert to the Indians.</p>
<p>If Thoreau does not deal dramatically with his Indians, yet he
had much that is interesting and suggestive to say about
them.&nbsp; These are some passages from <i>A Week on the
Concord</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We talk of civilizing the Indians, but that
is not the <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>name for his improvement.&nbsp; By
the wary independence and aloofness of his dim forest-life he
preserves his intercourse with his native gods, and is admitted
from time to time to a rare and peculiar society with
Nature.&nbsp; He has glances of starry recognition to which our
salons are strangers.&nbsp; The steady illumination of his
genius, dim only because distant, is like the faint but
satisfying light of the stars compared with the dazzling but
ineffectual and short-lived blaze of candles. . . .&nbsp; We
would not always be soothing and taming Nature, breaking the
horse and the ox, but sometimes ride the horse wild and chase the
buffalo.&nbsp; The Indian&rsquo;s intercourse with Nature is at
least such as admits of the greatest independence of each.&nbsp;
If he is somewhat of a stranger in her midst, the gardener is too
much of a familiar.&nbsp; There is something vulgar and foul in
the latter&rsquo;s closeness to his mistress, something noble and
cleanly in the former&rsquo;s distance.&nbsp; In civilization, as
in a southern latitude, man degenerates at length and yields to
the incursion of more northern tribes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some nations yet shut in<br />
With hills of ice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are other savager and more primeval aspects of
Nature than our poets have sung.&nbsp; It is only white
man&rsquo;s poetry&mdash;Homer and Ossian even can never revive
in London or Boston.&nbsp; And yet behold how these cities are
refreshed by the mere tradition or the imperfectly transmitted
fragrance and flavour of these wild fruits.&nbsp; If one could
listen but for an instant to the chant of the Indian muse, we
should understand why he will <!-- page 100--><a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>not
exchange his savageness for civilization.&nbsp; Nations are not
whimsical.&nbsp; Steel and blankets are strong temptations, but
the Indian does well to continue Indian.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are no empty generalizations, but the comments of a man
who has observed closely and sympathetically.&nbsp; All of
Thoreau&rsquo;s references to Indian life merit the closest
attention.&nbsp; For, as I have said, they help to explain the
man himself.&nbsp; He had a sufficient touch of wildness to be
able to detach himself from the civilized man&rsquo;s point of
view.&nbsp; Hence the life of the woods came so naturally to
him.&nbsp; The luxuries, the excitements, that mean so much to
some, Thoreau passed by indifferently.&nbsp; There is much talk
to-day of &ldquo;the simple life,&rdquo; and the phrase has
become tainted with affectation.&nbsp; Often it means nothing
more than a passing fad on the part of overfed society people who
are anxious for a new sensation.&nbsp; A fad with a moral flavour
about it will always commend itself to a certain section.&nbsp;
Certainly it is quite innocuous, but, on the other hand, it is
quite superficial.&nbsp; There is no real intention of living a
simple life any more than there is any deep resolve on the part
of the man who takes the Waters annually to abstain in the future
from over-eating.&nbsp; But with Thoreau the simple life was a
vital reality.&nbsp; He was not devoid of American
self-consciousness, and perhaps he pats himself on the back for
his healthy tastes more often than we should like.&nbsp; But of
his fundamental sincerity there can be no question.</p>
<p>He saw even more clearly than Emerson the futility and
debilitating effect of extravagance and luxury&mdash;<!-- page
101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>especially American luxury.&nbsp; And his whole life
was an indignant protest.</p>
<p>Yet it is a mistake to think (as some do) that he favoured a
kind of Rousseau-like &ldquo;Return to Nature,&rdquo; without any
regard to the conventions of civilization.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
not,&rdquo; he states emphatically, &ldquo;for a man to put
himself in opposition to society, but to maintain himself in
whatever attitude he finds himself through obedience to the laws
of his own being, which will never be one of opposition to a just
government.&nbsp; I left the woods for as good a reason as I went
there.&nbsp; Perhaps it seemed to me that I had several more
lives to live, and could not spare any more time for that
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is not the language of a crank, or the words of a man
who, as Lowell unfairly said, seemed &ldquo;to insist in public
in going back to flint and steel when there is a match-box in his
pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lowell&rsquo;s criticism of Thoreau, indeed, is quite wide of
the mark.&nbsp; It assumes throughout that Thoreau aimed at
&ldquo;an entire independence of mankind,&rdquo; when Thoreau
himself repeatedly says that he aimed at nothing of the
sort.&nbsp; He made an experiment for the purpose of seeing what
a simple, frugal, open-air life would do for him.&nbsp; The
experiment being made, he returned quietly to the conditions of
ordinary life.&nbsp; But he did not lack self-assurance, and his
frank satisfaction with the results of his experiment was not
altogether pleasing to those who had scant sympathy with his
passion for the Earth.</p>
<p>To be quite fair to Lowell and other hostile critics one must
admit that, genuine as Thoreau was, he had <!-- page 102--><a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>the habit
common to all self-contained and self-opiniated men of talking at
times as though his very idiosyncrasies were rules of conduct
imperative upon others.&nbsp; His theory of life was sound
enough, his demand for simple modes of living, for a closer
communion with Nature, for a more sympathetic understanding of
the &ldquo;brute creation,&rdquo; were reasonable beyond
question.&nbsp; But the Emersonian mannerism (which gives an
appearance of dogmatism, when no dogmatism is intended) starts up
from time to time and gives the reader the impression that the
path to salvation traverses Walden, all other paths being
negligible, and that you cannot attain perfection unless you keep
a pet squirrel.</p>
<p>But if a sentence here and there has an annoying flavour of
complacent dogmatism, and if the note of self-assertion grows too
loud on occasion for our sensitive ears, <a
name="citation102"></a><a href="#footnote102"
class="citation">[102]</a> yet his life and writings considered
as a whole do not assuredly favour verdicts so unfavourable as
those of Lowell and Stevenson.</p>
<p>Swagger and exaggeration may be irritating, but after all the
important thing is whether a man has anything to swagger about,
whether the case which he exaggerates is at heart sane and
just.</p>
<p>Every Vagabond swaggers because he is an egotist more or less,
and relishes keenly the life he has mapped out for himself.&nbsp;
But the swagger is of the harmless kind; it is not really
offensive; it is a sort of childish exuberance that plays over
the surface of his mind, <!-- page 103--><a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>without
injuring it, the harmless vanity of one who having escaped from
the schoolhouse of convention congratulates himself on his good
luck.</p>
<p>Swagger of this order you will find in the writings even of
that quiet, unassuming little man De Quincey.&nbsp; Hazlitt had
no small measure of it, and certainly it meets us in the company
of Borrow.&nbsp; It is very noticeable in Whitman&mdash;far more
so than in Thoreau.&nbsp; Why then does this quality tend to
exasperate more when we find it in <i>Walden</i>?&nbsp; Why has
Thoreau&rsquo;s sincerity been impugned and Whitman
escaped?&nbsp; Why are Thoreau&rsquo;s mannerisms greeted with
angry frowns, and the mannerisms, say of Borrow, regarded with
good-humoured intolerance?&nbsp; Chiefly, I think, because of
Thoreau&rsquo;s desperate efforts to justify his healthy
Vagabondage by Emersonian formulas.</p>
<p>I am not speaking of his sane and comprehensive philosophy of
life.&nbsp; The Vagabond has his philosophy of life no less than
the moralist, though as a rule he is content to let it lie
implicit in his writings, and is not anxious to turn it into a
gospel.&nbsp; But he did not always realize the difference
between moral characteristics and temperamental peculiarities,
and many of his admirers have done him ill service by trying to
make of his very Vagabondage (admirable enough in its way) a rule
of faith for all and sundry.&nbsp; Indeed, I think that much of
the resentment expressed against Thoreau by level-headed critics
is due to the unwise eulogy of friends.</p>
<p>Thoreau has become an object of worship to the crank, and in
our annoyance with the crank&mdash;who is often a <!-- page
104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>genuine reformer destitute of humour&mdash;we are apt
to jumble up devotee and idol together.&nbsp; Idol-worship never
does any good to the idol.</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>As a thinker Thoreau is suggestive and stimulating, except
when he tries to systematize.&nbsp; Naturally I think he had a
discursive and inquisitive, rather than a profound and analytical
mind.&nbsp; He was in sympathy with Eastern modes of regarding
life; and the pantheistic tendency of his religious thought,
especially his care and reverence for all forms of life, suggest
the devout Buddhist.&nbsp; The varied references scattered
throughout his writings to the Sacred Books of the East show how
Orientalism affected him.</p>
<p>Herein we touch upon the most attractive side of the man; for
it is this Orientalism, I think, in his nature that explains his
regard for, and his sympathy with, the birds and animals.</p>
<p>The tenderness of the Buddhist towards the lower creation is
not due to sentimentalism, nor is it necessarily a sign of
sensitiveness of feeling.&nbsp; In his profoundly interesting
study of the Burmese people Mr. Fielding Hall has summed up
admirably the teaching of Buddha: &ldquo;Be in love with all
things, not only with your fellows, but with the whole world,
with every creature that walks the earth, with the birds in the
air, with the insects in the grass.&nbsp; All life is akin to
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; The oneness of life is realized by the Eastern
as it seldom is by the <!-- page 105--><a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>Western.&nbsp; The love that stirs in your heart
kindled the flower into beauty, and broods in the great silent
pools of the forest.</p>
<p>But Nature is not always kind.&nbsp; That he cannot help
feeling.&nbsp; She inspires fear as well as love.&nbsp; She
scatters peace and consolation, but can scatter also pain and
death.&nbsp; All forms of life are more or less sacred.&nbsp; The
creatures of the forest whose ferocity and cunning are manifest,
may they not be inhabited by some human spirit that has misused
his opportunities in life?&nbsp; Thus they have an affinity with
us, and are signs of what we may become.</p>
<p>And if a measure of sacredness attaches to all life, however
unfriendly and harmful it may seem, the gentler forms of life are
especially to be objects of reverence and affection.</p>
<p>In one particular, however, Thoreau&rsquo;s attitude towards
the earth and all that therein is differed from the Buddhist,
inasmuch as the fear that enters into the Eastern&rsquo;s
Earth-worship was entirely purged from his mind.&nbsp; Mr. Page
has instituted a suggestive comparison between Thoreau and St.
Francis d&rsquo;Assisi.&nbsp; Certainly the rare magnetic
attraction which Thoreau seemed to have exercised over his
&ldquo;brute friends&rdquo; was quite as remarkable as the power
attributed to St. Francis, and it is true to say that in both
cases the sympathy for animals is constantly justified by a
reference to a dim but real brotherhood.&nbsp; The brutes are
&ldquo;undeveloped men&rdquo;; they await their transformation
and stand on their defence; and it is very easy to see that
inseparably bound up with this view there are certain elements of
<!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>mysticism common to the early saint and the American
&ldquo;hut builder.&rdquo; <a name="citation106"></a><a
href="#footnote106" class="citation">[106]</a></p>
<p>And yet, perhaps, Mr. Page presses the analogy between the
medieval saint and the American &ldquo;poet-naturalist&rdquo; too
far.&nbsp; St. Francis had an ardent, passionate nature, and
whether leading a life of dissipation or tending to the poor,
there is about him a royal impulsiveness, a passionate
abandonment, pointing to a temperament far removed from
Thoreau&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Prodigal in his charities, riotous in his very austerities,
his tenderness towards the animals seems like the overflowing of
a finely sensitive and artistic nature.&nbsp; With Thoreau one
feels in the presence of a more tranquil, more self-contained
spirit; his affection is the affection of a kindly scientist who
is intensely interested in the ways and habits of birds, beasts,
and fishes; one who does not give them the surplus of the love he
bears towards his fellow-men so much as a care and love which he
does not extend so freely towards his fellows.&nbsp; I do not
mean that he was apathetic, especially when his fellow-creatures
were in trouble; his eloquent defence of John Brown, his
kindliness towards simple folk, are sufficient testimony on this
score.&nbsp; But on the whole his interest in men and women was
an abstract kind of interest; he showed none of the personal
curiosity and eager inquisitiveness about them that he showed
towards the denizens of the woods and streams.&nbsp; And if you
are not heartily interested in your fellow-men you will not love
them very deeply.</p>
<p>I am not sure that Hawthorne was so far out in his <!-- page
107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>characterization &ldquo;Donatello&rdquo;&mdash;the
creature half-animal, half-man, which he says was suggested by
Thoreau.&nbsp; It does not pretend to realize all his
characteristics, nor do justice to his fine qualities.&nbsp; None
the less in its picture of a man with a flavour of the wild and
untameable about him&mdash;whose uncivilized nature brings him
into a close and vital intimacy with the animal world, we detect
a real psychological affinity with Thoreau.&nbsp; May not
Thoreau&rsquo;s energetic rebukes of the evils of civilization
have received an added zest from his instinctive repugnance to
many of the civilized amenities valued by the majority?</p>
<p>Many of Thoreau&rsquo;s admirers&mdash;including Mr. Page and
Mr. Salt&mdash;defend him stoutly against the charge of
unsociability, and they see in this feeling for the brute
creation an illustration of his warm humanitarianism.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thoreau loves the animals,&rdquo; says Mr. Page,
&ldquo;because they are manlike and seem to yearn toward human
forms.&rdquo;&nbsp; It seems to me that Thoreau&rsquo;s affection
was a much simpler affair than this.&nbsp; He was drawn towards
them because <i>he</i> felt an affinity with them&mdash;an
affinity more compelling in its attraction than the affinity of
the average human person.</p>
<p>No doubt he felt, as Shelley did when he spoke of &ldquo;birds
and even insects&rdquo; as his &ldquo;kindred,&rdquo; that this
affinity bespoke a wider brotherhood of feeling than men are
usually ready to acknowledge.&nbsp; But this is not the same as
loving animals <i>because</i> they are manlike.&nbsp; He loved
them surely because they were <i>living</i> things, and he was
drawn towards all living things, not because he detected any
semblance to humankind in them.&nbsp; The <!-- page 108--><a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>difference
between these two attitudes is not easy to define clearly; but it
is a real, not a nominal difference.</p>
<p>It is argued, however, as another instance of Thoreau&rsquo;s
undervalued sociability, that he was very fond of children.&nbsp;
That he was fond of children may be admitted, and some of the
pleasantest stories about him relate to his rambles with
children.&nbsp; His huckleberry parties were justly famous, if
report speaks true.&nbsp; &ldquo;His resources for
entertainment,&rdquo; says Mr. Moncure Conway, &ldquo;were
inexhaustible.&nbsp; He would tell stories of the Indians who
once dwelt thereabouts till the children almost looked to see a
red man skulking with his arrow and stone, and every plant or
flower on the bank or in the water, and every fish, turtle, frog,
lizard about was transformed by the wand of his knowledge from
the low form into which the spell of our ignorance had reduced it
into a mystic beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emerson and his children frequently accompanied him on these
expeditions.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whom shall we ask?&rdquo; demanded
Emerson&rsquo;s little daughter.&nbsp; &ldquo;All children from
six to sixty,&rdquo; replied her father.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thoreau,&rdquo; writes Mr. Conway in his
<i>Reminiscences</i>, &ldquo;was the guide, for he knew the
precise locality of every variety of berry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Edward Emerson, on one occasion, carrying a
basket of fine huckleberries, had a fall and spilt them
all.&nbsp; Great was his distress, and offers of berries could
not console him for the loss of those gathered by himself.&nbsp;
But Thoreau came, put his arm round the troubled child, and
explained to him that if the crop of huckleberries was to
continue it was necessary that some <!-- page 109--><a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>should be
scattered.&nbsp; Nature had provided that little boys and girls
should now and then stumble and sow the berries.&nbsp; &lsquo;We
shall,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;have a grand lot of bushes and
berries on this spot, and we shall owe them to you.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Edward began to smile.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoreau evidently knew how to console a child, no less than
how to make friends with a squirrel.&nbsp; But his fondness for
children is no more an argument for his sociability, than his
fondness for birds or squirrels.&nbsp; As a rule it will be
found, I think, that a predilection for children is most marked
in men generally reserved and inaccessible.&nbsp; Lewis Carroll,
for instance, to take a famous recent example, was the reverse of
a sociable man.&nbsp; Shy, reserved, even cold in ordinary
converse, he would expand immediately when in the company of
children.&nbsp; Certainly he understood them much better than he
did their elders.&nbsp; Like Thoreau, moreover, Lewis Carroll was
a lover of animals.</p>
<p>Social adaptability was not a characteristic of Thackeray, his
moroseness and reserve frequently alienating people; yet no one
was more devoted to children, or a more delightful friend to
them.</p>
<p>So far from being an argument in favour of its
possessor&rsquo;s sociability, it seems to be a tolerable
argument against it.&nbsp; It is not hard to understand
why.&nbsp; When analysed this fondness for children is much the
same in quality as the fondness for animals.&nbsp; A man is drawn
towards children because there is something fresh,
unsophisticated, and elemental about them.&nbsp; It has no
reference to their moral qualities, though the &aelig;sthetic
element plays a share.&nbsp; Thoreau knew how to comfort <!--
page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>little Edward Emerson just as he knew how to cheer the
squirrel that sought a refuge in his waistcoat.&nbsp; This
fondness, however, must not be confused with the paternal
instinct.&nbsp; A man may desire to have children, realize that
desire, interest himself in their welfare, and yet not be really
fond of them.&nbsp; As children they may not attract him, but he
regards them as possibilities for perpetuating the family and for
enhancing its prestige.</p>
<p>A good deal of nonsense is talked about the purity and
innocence of childhood.&nbsp; Children are consequently brought
up in a morbidly sentimental atmosphere that makes of them too
quickly little prigs or little hypocrites.&nbsp; I do not
believe, however, that any man or woman who is genuinely fond of
children is moved by this artificial point of view.&nbsp; The
innocence and purity of children is a middle-class
convention.&nbsp; None but the unreal sentimentalist really
believes in it.&nbsp; What attracts us most in children is
naturalness and simplicity.&nbsp; We note in them the frank
predominance of the instinctive life, and they charm us in many
ways just as young animals do.</p>
<p>Lewis Carroll&rsquo;s biographer speaks of &ldquo;his intense
admiration for the white innocence and uncontaminated
spirituality of childhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If this be true then it shows that the Rev. C. L. Dodgson had
a great deal to learn about children, who are, or should be,
healthy little pagans.&nbsp; But though his liking for them may
not have been free of the sentimental taint, there is abundant
proof that other less debatable qualities in childhood appealed
to him with much greater force.</p>
<p><!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>&ldquo;Uncontaminated spirituality,&rdquo;
forsooth.&nbsp; I would as soon speak of the uncontaminated
spirituality of a rabbit.&nbsp; I am sure rabbits are a good deal
more lovable than some children.</p>
<p>Thoreau&rsquo;s love of children, then, seems to be only a
fresh instance of his attraction towards simpler, more elemental
forms of life.&nbsp; Men and women not ringed round by civilized
conventions, children who have the freshness and wildness of the
woods about them; such were the human beings that interested
him.</p>
<p>Such an attitude has its advantages as well as its
limitations.&nbsp; It calls neither for the censorious blame
visited upon Thoreau by some of the critics nor the
indiscriminate eulogy bestowed on him by others.</p>
<p>The Vagabond who withdraws himself to any extent from the life
of his day, who declines to conform to many of its arbitrary
conventions, escapes much of the fret and tear, the heart-aching
and the disillusionment that others share in.&nbsp; He retains a
freshness, a simplicity, a joyfulness, not vouchsafed to those
who stay at home and never wander beyond the prescribed
limits.&nbsp; He exhibits an individuality which is more
genuinely the legitimate expression of his temperament.&nbsp; It
is not warped, crossed, suppressed, as many are.</p>
<p>And this is why the literary Vagabond is such excellent
company, having wandered from the beaten track he has much to
tell others of us who have stayed at home.&nbsp; There is a wild
luxuriance about his character that is interesting and
fascinating&mdash;if you are not thrown for too long in his
company.&nbsp; The riotous growth of eccentricities and
idiosyncrasies are picturesque <!-- page 112--><a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>enough,
though you must expect to find thorns and briars.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we must beware of sentimentalizing the
Vagabond, and to present him as an ideal figure&mdash;as some
enthusiasts have done&mdash;seems to me a mistake.&nbsp; As a
wholesome bitter corrective to the monotonous sweet of
civilization he is admirable enough.&nbsp; Of his tonic influence
in literature there can be no question.&nbsp; But it is well for
the Vagabond to be in the minority.&nbsp; Perhaps these
considerations should come at the close of the series of Vagabond
studies, but they arise naturally when considering
Thoreau&mdash;for Thoreau is one of the few Vagabonds whom his
admirers have tried to canonize.&nbsp; Not content with the
striking qualities which the Vagabond naturally exhibits, some of
his admirers cannot rest without dragging in other qualities to
which he has no claim.&nbsp; Why try to prove that Thoreau was
really a most sociable character, that Whitman was the
profoundest philosopher of his day, that Jefferies was&mdash;deep
down&mdash;a conventionally religious man?&nbsp; Why, oh why, may
we not leave them in their pleasant wildness without trying to
make out that they were the best company in the world for
five-o&rsquo;clock teas and chapel meetings?</p>
<p>For&mdash;and it is well to admit it frankly&mdash;the
Vagabond loses as well as gains by his deliberate withdrawal from
the world.&nbsp; No man can live to himself without some injury
to his character.&nbsp; The very cares and worries, the checks
and clashings, consequent on meeting other individualities tend
to keep down the egotistic elements in a man&rsquo;s
nature.&nbsp; The necessary give and take, the <!-- page 113--><a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>sacrifice
of self-interests, the little abnegations, the moral adjustment
following the appreciation of other points of view; all these
things are good for men and women.&nbsp; Yes, and it is good even
to mix with very conventional people&mdash;I do not say live with
them&mdash;however distasteful it may be, for the excessive
caution, the prudential, opportunistic qualities they exhibit,
serve a useful purpose in the scheme of things.&nbsp; The ideal
thing, no doubt, is to mix with as many types, as many varieties
of the human species, as possible.&nbsp; Browning owes his great
power as a poet to his tireless interest in all sorts and
conditions of men and women.</p>
<p>It is idle to pretend then that Thoreau lost nothing by his
experiments, and by the life he fashioned for himself.&nbsp;
Nature gives us plenty of choice; we are invited to help
ourselves, but everything must be paid for.&nbsp; There are
drawbacks as well as compensations; and the most a man can do is
to strike a balance.</p>
<p>And in Thoreau&rsquo;s case the balance was a generous
one.</p>
<p>Better than his moralizing, better than his varied culture,
was his intimacy with Nature.&nbsp; Moralists are plentiful,
scholars abound, but men in close, vital sympathy with the Earth,
a sympathy that comprehends because it loves, and loves because
it comprehends, are rare.&nbsp; Let us make the most of them.</p>
<p>In one of his most striking Nature poems Mr. George Meredith
exclaims:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Enter these enchanted woods,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You who dare.<br />
Nothing harms beneath the leaves<br />
More than waves a swimmer cleaves.<br />
<!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>Toss your heart up with the lark,<br />
Foot at peace with mouse and worm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fair you fare,<br />
Only at a dread of dark<br />
Quaver, and they quit their form:<br />
Thousand eyeballs under hoods<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you by the hair.<br />
Enter these enchanted woods,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You who dare.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So to understand Nature you must trust her, otherwise she will
remain at heart fearsome and cryptic.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You must love the light so well<br />
That no darkness will seem fell;<br />
Love it so you could accost<br />
Fellowly a livid ghost.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Meredith requires us to approach Nature with an unswerving
faith in her goodness.</p>
<p>No easy thing assuredly; and to some minds this attitude will
express a facile optimism.&nbsp; Approve it or reject it,
however, as we may, &rsquo;tis a philosophy that can claim many
and diverse adherents, for it is no dusty formula of academic
thought, but a message of the sunshine and the winds.&nbsp; Talk
of suffering and death to the Vagabond, and he will reply as did
Petulengro, &ldquo;Life is sweet, brother.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not that
he ignores other matters, but it is sufficient for him that
&ldquo;life is sweet.&rdquo;&nbsp; And after all he speaks as to
what he has known.</p>

<h3>I</h3>
<p>Romance!&nbsp; At times it passes athwart our vision, yet no
sooner seen than gone; at times it sounds in our ears, only to
tremble into silence ere we realize it; at times it touches our
lips, and is felt in the blood, but our outstretched arms gather
naught but the vacant air.&nbsp; The scent of a flower, the
splendour of a sunrise, the glimmer of a star, and it wakens into
being.&nbsp; Sometimes when standing in familiar places, speaking
on matters of every day, suddenly, unexpectedly, it manifests its
presence.&nbsp; A turn of the head, a look in the eye, an
inflection of the voice, and this strange, indefinable thing
stirs within us.&nbsp; Or, it may be, we are alone, <!-- page
118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>traversing some dusty highway of thought, when in a
flash some long-forgotten memory starts at our very feet, and we
realize that Romance is alive.</p>
<p>I would fain deem Romance a twin&mdash;a brother and
sister.&nbsp; The one fair and radiant with the sunlight, strong
and clean-fibred, warm of blood and joyous of spirit; a creature
of laughter and delight.&nbsp; I would fancy him regarding the
world with clear, shining eyes, faintly parted lips, a buoyant
expectancy in every line of his tense figure.&nbsp; Ready for
anything and everything; the world opening up before him like a
white, alluring road; tasting curiously every adventure, as a man
plucks fruit by the wayside, knowing no horizon to his outlook,
no end to his journey, no limit to his enterprise.</p>
<p>As such I see one of the twins.&nbsp; And the other?&nbsp;
Dark and wonderful; the fragrance of poesy about her hair, the
magic of mystery in her unfathomable eyes.&nbsp; Sweet is her
voice and her countenance is comely.&nbsp; A creature of
moonlight and starshine.&nbsp; She follows in the wake of her
brother; but his ways are not her ways.&nbsp; Away, out of sound
of his mellow laughter, she is the spirit that haunts lonely
places.&nbsp; There is no price by which you may win her, no
entreaty to which she will respond.&nbsp; Compel her you cannot,
woo her you may not.&nbsp; Yet, uninvited, unbidden, she will
steal into the garret, gaunt in its lonesome ugliness, and bend
over the wasted form of some poor literary hack, until his dreams
reflect the beauty of her presence.</p>
<p>And yet, when one&rsquo;s fancy has run riot in order to
recall Romance, how much remains that cannot be put 
<a href="images/p118b.jpg">
<img class='clearcenter' alt=

"Robert Louis Stevenson"
src="images/p118s.jpg" />
</a><!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>into words.&nbsp; One thing,
however, is certain.&nbsp; Romance must be large and generous
enough to comprehend the full-blooded geniality of a Scott, the
impalpable mystery of a Coleridge or Shelley, to extend a hand to
the sun-tanned William Morris, and the lover of twilight,
Nathaniel Hawthorne.</p>
<p>Borrow was a Romantic, so is Stevenson.&nbsp; Scott was a
Romantic, likewise Edgar Allan Poe.&nbsp; If Romance be not a
twin, then it must change its form and visage wondrously to
appeal to temperaments so divergent.&nbsp; But if Romance be a
twin (the conceit will serve our purpose) then one may realize
how Scott and Borrow followed in the brother&rsquo;s wake;
Stevenson and Poe being drawn rather towards the sister.</p>
<p>In the case of Stevenson it may seem strange that one who
wrote stirring adventures, who delighted boys of all ages with
<i>Treasure Island</i> and <i>Black Arrow</i> (oh, excellent John
Silver!), and followed in the steps of Sir Walter in <i>The
Master of Ballantrae</i> and <i>Catriona</i>, should not be
associated with the adventurous brother.&nbsp; But Scott and
Stevenson have really nothing in common, beyond a love for the
picturesque&mdash;and there is nothing distinctive in that.&nbsp;
It is an essential qualification in the equipment of every
Romantic.&nbsp; Adventures, as such, did not appeal to Stevenson,
I think; it was the spice of mystery in them that attracted
him.&nbsp; Watch him and you will find he is not content until he
has thrown clouds of phantasy over his pictures.&nbsp; His longer
stories have no unity&mdash;they are disconnected episodes strung
lightly together, and this is why his short stories impress us
far more with their power and brilliance.</p>
<p><!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span><i>Markheim</i> and <i>Jekyll and Hyde</i> do not
oppress the imagination in the same way as do Poe&rsquo;s tales
of horror; but they show the same passion for the dark corners of
life, the same fondness for the gargoyles of Art.&nbsp; This is
Romance on its mystic side.</p>
<p>Throughout his writings&mdash;I say nothing of his letters,
which stand in a different category&mdash;one can hear</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The horns of Elfland faintly
blowing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes the veil of phantasy is shaken by a peal of impish
laughter, as if he would say, &ldquo;Lord, what fools these
mortals be!&rdquo; but the attitude that persists&mdash;breaks
there must be, and gusty moods, or it would not be
Stevenson&mdash;is the attitude of the Romantic who loves rather
the night side of things.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Much has been written about the eternal boy in
Stevenson.&nbsp; I confess that this does not strike me as a
particularly happy criticism.&nbsp; In a superficial sort of way
it is, of course, obvious enough; he was fond of
&ldquo;make-believe&rdquo;; took a boyish delight in practical
joking; was ever ready for an adventure.&nbsp; But so complex and
diverse his temperament that it is dangerous to seize on one
aspect and say, &ldquo;There is the real Stevenson.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Ariel, Hamlet, and the Shorter Catechist cross and recross his
pages as we read them.&nbsp; Probably each reader of Stevenson
retains most clearly one special phase.&nbsp; It is the Ariel in
Stevenson that outlasts for <!-- page 121--><a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>me the
other moods.&nbsp; If any one phase can be said to strike the
keynote of his temperament, it is the whimsical, freakish, but
kindly Ariel&mdash;an Ariel bound in service to the Prospero of
fiction&mdash;never quite happy, longing for his freedom, yet
knowing that he must for a while serve his master.&nbsp; One can
well understand why John Addington Symonds dubbed Stevenson
&ldquo;sprite.&rdquo;&nbsp; This elfish dement in Stevenson is
most apparent in his letters and stories.</p>
<p>The figures in his stories are less flesh-and-blood persons
than the shapes&mdash;some gracious, some terrifying&mdash;that
the Ariel world invoke.&nbsp; It is not that Stevenson had no
grip on reality; his grip-hold on life was very firm and
real.&nbsp; Beneath the light badinage, the airy, graceful wit
that plays over his correspondence, there is a steel-like
tenacity.&nbsp; But in his stories he leaves the solid earth for
a phantastic world of his own.&nbsp; He does so deliberately: he
turns his back on reality, has dealings with phantom
passions.&nbsp; His historical romances are like ghostly editions
of Scott.&nbsp; There is light, but little heat in his
fictions.&nbsp; They charm our fancy, but do not seize upon our
imagination.&nbsp; Stevenson&rsquo;s novels remind one of an old
<i>Punch</i> joke about the man who chose a wife to match his
furniture.&nbsp; Stevenson chooses his personages to match his
furniture&mdash;his cunningly-woven tapestries of style; and the
result is that we are too conscious of the tapestry on the wall,
too little conscious of the people who move about the
rooms.&nbsp; If only Stevenson had suited his style to his
matter, as he does in his letters, which are written in fine
Vagabond spirit&mdash;his romances would have seemed less <!--
page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>artificial.&nbsp; I say <i>seemed</i>, for it was the
stylist that stood in the way of the story-teller.&nbsp;
Stevenson&rsquo;s sense of character was keen enough,
particularly in his ripe, old &ldquo;disreputables.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But much of his remarkable psychology was lost, it seems to me,
by the lack of dramatic presentment.</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s characters do not speak Borrow so emphatically
as do Stevenson&rsquo;s characters speak Stevenson.&nbsp; And
with Stevenson it matters more.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s picturesque,
vivid, but loose, loquacious style, fits his subject-matter on
the whole very well.&nbsp; But Stevenson&rsquo;s delicate,
nervous, mannerized style suits but ill some of the scenes he is
describing.&nbsp; If it suits, it suits by a happy accident, as
in the delightful sentimentality, <i>Providence and the
Guitar</i>.</p>
<p>To appraise Stevenson&rsquo;s merits as a Romantic one has to
read him after reading Scott, Dumas, Victor Hugo; or, better
still, to peruse these giants after dallying with Ariel.</p>
<p>We realize then what it is that we had vaguely missed in
Stevenson&mdash;the human touch.&nbsp; These men believe in the
figments of their imagination, and make us believe in them.</p>
<p>Stevenson is obviously sceptical as to their reality; we can
almost see a furtive smile upon his lip as he writes.&nbsp; But
there is nothing unreal about the man, whatever we feel of the
Artist.</p>
<p>In his critical comments on men and matters, especially when
Hamlet and the Shorter Catechist come into view, we shall find a
vigorous sanity, a shrewd yet genial outlook, that seems to say
there is no make-believe <!-- page 123--><a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span><i>here</i>; <i>here</i> I am not merely amusing
myself; here, honestly and heartily admitted, you may find the
things that life has taught me.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>Stevenson had many sides, but there were two especially that
reappear again and again, and were the controlling forces in his
nature.&nbsp; One was the Romantic element, the other the
Artistic.&nbsp; It may be thought that these twain have much in
common; but it is not so.&nbsp; In poetry the first gives us a
Blake, a Shelley; the second a Keats, a Tennyson.&nbsp; Variety,
fresh points of view, these are the breath of life to the
Romantic.&nbsp; But for the Artist there is one constant,
unchanging ideal.&nbsp; The Romantic ventures out of sheer love
of the venture, the other out of sheer love for some definite end
in view.&nbsp; It is not usual to find them coexisting as they
did in Stevenson, and their dual existence gives an added
piquancy and interest to his work.&nbsp; It is the Vagabond
Romantic in him that leads him into so many byways and secret
places, that sends him airily dancing over the wide fields of
literature; ever on the move, making no tabernacle for himself in
any one grove.&nbsp; And it is the Artist who gives that delicacy
of finish, that exquisitive nicety of touch, to the veriest
trifle that he essays.&nbsp; The matter may be beggarly, the
manner is princely.</p>
<p>Mark the high ideal he sets before him: &ldquo;The Artist
works entirely upon honour.&nbsp; The Public knows little <!--
page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>or nothing of those merits in its quest of which you
are condemned to spend the bulk of your endeavours.&nbsp; Merits
of design, the merit of first-hand energy, the merit of a certain
cheap accomplishment, which a man of the artistic temper easily
acquires; these they can recognize, and these they value.&nbsp;
But to those more exquisite refinements of proficiency and
finish, which the Artist so ardently desires and so keenly feels,
for which (in the vigorous words of Balzac) he must toil
&lsquo;like a miner buried in a landslip,&rsquo; for which day
after day he recasts and revises and rejects, the gross mass of
the Public must be ever blind.&nbsp; To those lost pains, suppose
you attain the highest point of merit, posterity may possibly do
justice; suppose, as is so probable, that you fail by even a
hair&rsquo;s breadth of the highest, rest certain they shall
never be observed.&nbsp; Under the shadow of this cold thought
alone in his studio the Artist must preserve from day to day his
constancy to the ideal.&rdquo; <a name="citation124a"></a><a
href="#footnote124a" class="citation">[124a]</a></p>
<p>An exacting ideal, but one to which Stevenson was as faithful
as a Calvinist to his theology.&nbsp; The question arises,
however; is the fastidiousness, the patient care of the Artist,
consistent with Vagabondage?&nbsp; Should one not say the greater
the stylist, the lesser the Vagabond?</p>
<p>This may be admitted.&nbsp; And thus it is that in the letters
alone do we find the Vagabond temperament of Stevenson fully
asserting itself.&nbsp; Elsewhere &rsquo;tis held in check.&nbsp;
As Mr. Sidney Colvin justly says: <a name="citation124b"></a><a
href="#footnote124b" class="citation">[124b]</a> &ldquo;In his
letters&mdash;<!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>excepting a few written in youth,
and having more or less the character of exercises, and a few in
after years which were intended for the public
eye&mdash;Stevenson, the deliberate artist is scarcely
forthcoming at all.&nbsp; He does not care a fig for order, or
logical sequence, or congruity, or for striking a key of
expression and keeping it, but becomes simply the most
spontaneous and unstudied of human beings.&nbsp; He will write
with the most distinguished eloquence on one day, with simple
good sense and good feeling on a second, with flat triviality on
another, and with the most slashing, often ultra-colloquial
vehemency on a fourth, or will vary through all these moods, and
more, in one and the same letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fresh and spontaneous his letters invariably appear; with a
touch of the invalid&rsquo;s nervous haste, but never lacking in
courage, and with nothing of the querulousness which we connect
with chronic ill-health.&nbsp; Weak and ailing, shadowed by death
for many years before the end, Stevenson showed a fine fortitude,
which will remain in the memory of his friends as his most
admirable character.&nbsp; With the consistency of Mark Tapley
(and with less talk about it) he determined to be jolly in all
possible circumstances.&nbsp; Right to the end his wonderful
spirits, his courageous gaiety attended him; the frail body grew
frailer, but the buoyant intellect never failed him, or if it did
so the failure was momentary, and in a moment he was
recovered.</p>
<p>No little of his popularity is due to the desperate valour
with which he contested the ground with death, inch by inch, and
died, as Buckle and John Richard Green had done, in the midst of
the work that he would <!-- page 126--><a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>not
quit.&nbsp; Romance was by him to the last, gladdening his tired
body with her presence; and if towards the end weariness and
heart-sickness seized him for a spell, yet the mind soon resumed
its mastery over weakness.&nbsp; In a prayer which he had written
shortly before his death he had petitioned: &ldquo;Give us to
awake with smiles, give us to labour smiling; as the sun lightens
the world, so let our lovingkindness make bright this house of
our habitation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Assuredly in his case this
characteristic petition had been realized; the prevalent
sunniness of his disposition attended him to the last.</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>Of all our writers there has been none to whom the epithet
&ldquo;charming&rdquo; has been more frequently applied.&nbsp; Of
late the epithet has become a kind of adjectival
maid-of-all-work, and has done service where a less emphatic term
would have done far better.&nbsp; But in Stevenson&rsquo;s case
the epithet is fully justified.&nbsp; Of all the literary
Vagabonds he is the most captivating.&nbsp; Not the most
interesting; the most arresting, one may admit.&nbsp; There is
greater power in Hazlitt; De Quincey is more unique; the
&ldquo;prophetic scream&rdquo; of Whitman is more
penetrating.&nbsp; But not one of them was endowed with such
wayward graces of disposition as Stevenson.&nbsp; Whatever you
read of his you think invariably of the man.&nbsp; Indeed the
personal note in his work is frequently the most interesting
thing about it.&nbsp; I mean that what attracts and holds us is
often not any originality, any profundity, nothing <!-- page
127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>specially inherent in the matter of his speech, but a
bewitchingly delightful manner.</p>
<p>Examine his attractive essays, <i>Virginibus Puerisque</i> and
<i>Familiar Studies of Men and Books</i>, and this quality will
manifest itself.&nbsp; There is no pleasanter essay than the one
on &ldquo;Walking Tours&rdquo;; it dresses up wholesome truths
with so pleasant and picturesque a wit; it is so whimsical, yet
withal so finely suggestive, that the reader who cannot yield to
its fascination should consult a mental specialist.</p>
<p>For instance:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It must not be imagined that a walking
tour, as some would have us fancy, is merely a better or worse
way of seeing the country.&nbsp; There are many ways of seeing
landscape quite as good; and none more vivid, in spite of canting
dilettantes, than from a railway train.&nbsp; But landscape on a
walking tour is quite accessory.&nbsp; He who is indeed of the
brotherhood does not voyage in quest of the picturesque, but of
certain jolly humours&mdash;of the hope and spirit with which the
march begins at morning, and the peace and spiritual repletion of
the evening&rsquo;s rest.&nbsp; He cannot tell whether he puts
his knapsack on or takes it off with more delight.&nbsp; The
excitement of the departure puts him in key for that of the
arrival.&nbsp; Whatever he does will be further rewarded in the
sequel; and so pleasure leads on to pleasure in an endless
chain.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An admirable opening, full of the right relish.&nbsp; And the
wit and relish are maintained down to the last sentence.&nbsp;
But it cannot fail to awaken memories of the great departed in
the reader of books.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now to <!-- page 128--><a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>be properly
enjoyed,&rdquo; counsels Stevenson, &ldquo;a walking tour should
be gone upon alone. . . . a walking tour should be gone upon
alone because freedom is of the essence,&rdquo; and so on in the
same vein for twenty or thirty lines.&nbsp; One immediately
recalls Hazlitt&mdash;&ldquo;On Going a Journey&rdquo;:
&ldquo;One of the pleasantest things is going on a journey; but I
like to go by myself. . . .&nbsp; The soul of a journey is
liberty, perfect liberty, to think, feel, do just as one
pleases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A suspicion seizes the mind of the reader, and he will smile
darkly to himself.&nbsp; But Stevenson is quite ready for
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;A strong flavour of Hazlitt, you think?&rdquo;
he seems to say, then with the frank ingenuousness of one who has
confessed to &ldquo;playing the sedulous ape,&rdquo; he throws in
a quotation from this very essay of Hazlitt&rsquo;s and later on
gives us more Hazlitt.&nbsp; It is impossible to resent it; it is
so openly done, there is such a charming effrontery about the
whole thing.&nbsp; And yet, though much that he says is obviously
inspired by Hazlitt, he will impart that flavour of his own less
mordant personality to the discourse.</p>
<p>If you turn to another, the &ldquo;Truth of
Intercourse,&rdquo; it is hard to feel that it would have thrived
had not Elia given up his &ldquo;Popular Fallacies.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There is an unmistakable echo in the opening paragraph:
&ldquo;Among sayings that have a currency, in spite of being
wholly false upon the face of them, for the sake of a half-truth
upon another subject which is accidentally combined with the
error, one of the grossest and broadest conveys the monstrous
proposition that it is easy to tell the truth and hard to tell a
lie.&nbsp; I wish heartily it were!&rdquo;&nbsp; Similarly in
<!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>other essays the influence of Montaigne is strongly
felt; and although Stevenson never fails to impart the flavour of
his own individuality to his discourses&mdash;for he is certainly
no mere copyist&mdash;one realizes the unwisdom of those
enthusiastic admirers who have bracketed him with Lamb,
Montaigne, and Hazlitt.&nbsp; These were men of the primary
order; whereas Stevenson with all his grace and charm is
assuredly of the secondary order.&nbsp; And no admiration for his
attractive personality and captivating utterances should blind us
to this fact.</p>
<p>As a critic of books his originality is perhaps more
pronounced, but wise and large though many of his utterances are,
here again it is the pleasant wayward Vagabond spirit that gives
salt and flavour to them.&nbsp; There are many critics less
brilliant, less attractive in their speech, in whose judgment I
should place greater reliance.&nbsp; Sometimes, as in the essay
on &ldquo;Victor Hugo&rsquo;s Romances,&rdquo; his own
temperament stands in the way; at other times, as in his
&ldquo;Thoreau&rdquo; article, there is a vein of wilful
capriciousness, even of impish malice, that distorts his
judgment.&nbsp; Neither essays can be passed over; in each there
is power and shrewd flashes of discernment, and both are
extremely interesting.&nbsp; One cannot say they are
satisfying.&nbsp; Stevenson does scant justice to the
extraordinary passion, the Titanic strength, of Hugo; and in the
case of Thoreau he dwells too harshly upon the less gracious
aspects of the &ldquo;poet-naturalist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is only fair to say, however, that in the case of Thoreau
he made generous amends in the preface to the Collected
Essays.&nbsp; Both the reconsidered verdict and <!-- page
130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>the original essay are highly characteristic of the
man.&nbsp; Other men have said equally harsh things of
Thoreau.&nbsp; Stevenson alone had the fairness, the frank,
childlike spirit to go back upon himself.&nbsp; These are the
things that endear us to Stevenson, and make it impossible to be
angry with any of his paradoxes and extravagant capers.&nbsp; Who
but Stevenson would have written thus: &ldquo;The most temperate
of living critics once marked a passage of my own with a cross
and the words, &lsquo;This seems nonsense.&rsquo;&nbsp; It not
only seemed, it was so.&nbsp; It was a private bravado of my own
which I had so often repeated to keep up my spirits that I had
grown at last wholly to believe it, and had ended by setting it
down as a contribution to the theory of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Touched by this confidence, one reads
Stevenson&mdash;especially the letters&mdash;with a more
discerning eye, a more compassionate understanding; and if at
times one feels the presence of the Ariel too strong, and longs
for a more human, less elfin personality, then the thought that
we are dealing with deliberate &ldquo;bravado&rdquo; may well
check our impatience.</p>
<p>Men who suffer much are wont to keep up a brave front by an
appearance of indifference.</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p>To turn now to another side of Stevenson&mdash;Stevenson the
Artist, the artificer of phrases, the limner of pictures.&nbsp;
His power here is shown in a threefold manner&mdash;in deft <!--
page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>and happy phrasing, in skilful characterization, in
delicately suggestive scenic descriptions.</p>
<p>This, for instance, as an instance of the first:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The victim begins to shrink spiritually; he
develops a fancy for parlours with a regulated atmosphere, and
takes his morality on the principle of tin shoes and tepid
milk.&nbsp; The care of one important body or soul becomes so
engrossing that all the noises of the outer world begin to come
thin and faint into the parlour with the regulated temperature;
and the tin shoes go equally forward over blood and ruin&rdquo;
(<i>New Arabian Nights</i>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or this:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whitman, like a large, shaggy dog, just
unchained, scouring the beaches of the world, and baying at the
moon&rdquo; (<i>Men and Books</i>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or this:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To have a catchword in your mouth is not
the same thing as to hold an opinion; still less is it the same
thing as to have made one for yourself.&nbsp; There are too many
of these catchwords in the world for people to rap out upon you
like an oath by way of an argument.&nbsp; They have a currency as
intellectual counters, and many respectable persons pay their way
with nothing else&rdquo; (<i>Virginibus Puerisque</i>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his characterization he is at his best&mdash;like Scott and
Borrow&mdash;when dealing with the picaresque elements in
life.&nbsp; His rogues are depicted with infinite gusto and
admirable art, and although even they, in common with most of his
characters, lack occasionally in substance and objective reality,
yet when he has to illustrate a characteristic he will do so with
a sure touch.</p>
<p><!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>Take, for instance, this sketch of Herrick in <i>The
Ebb Tide</i>&mdash;the weak, irresolute rascal, with just force
enough to hate himself.&nbsp; He essays to end his ignominious
career in the swift waters:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>. . . &ldquo;Let him lie down with all races and
generations of men in the house of sleep.&nbsp; It was easy to
say, easy to do.&nbsp; To stop swimming; there was no mystery in
that, if he could do it.&nbsp; Could he?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he could not.&nbsp; He knew it instantly.&nbsp; He
was instantly aware of an opposition in his members, unanimous
and invincible, clinging to life with a single and fixed resolve,
finger by finger, sinew by sinew; something that was at once he
and not he&mdash;at once within and without him; the shutting of
some miniature valve within the brain, which a single manly
thought would suffice to open&mdash;and the grasp of an external
fate ineluctable to gravity.&nbsp; To any man there may come at
times a consciousness that there blows, through all the
articulations of his body, the wind of a spirit not wholly his;
that his mind rebels; that another girds him, and carries him
whither he would not.&nbsp; It came even to Herrick with the
authority of a revelation&mdash;there was no escape
possible.&nbsp; The open door was closed in his recreant
face.&nbsp; He must go back into the world and amongst men
without illusion.&nbsp; He must stagger on to the end with the
pack of his responsibility and disgrace, until a cold, a
blow&mdash;a merciful chance blow&mdash;or the more merciful
hangman should dismiss him from his infamy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were men who could commit suicide; there were men
who could not; and he was one who could <!-- page 133--><a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>not.&nbsp;
His smile was tragic.&nbsp; He could have spat upon
himself.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Profoundly dissimilar in many ways, one psychological link
binds together Dickens, Browning, and Stevenson&mdash;a love of
the grotesque, a passion for the queer, phantastic sides of
life.&nbsp; Each of them relished the tang of roughness, and in
Browning&rsquo;s case the relish imparts itself to his
style.&nbsp; Not so with Stevenson.&nbsp; He will delve with the
others for curious treasure; but not until it is fairly wrought
and beaten into a thing of finished beauty will he allow you to
get a glimpse of it.</p>
<p>This is different from Browning, who will fling his treasures
at you with all the mud upon them.&nbsp; But I am not sure that
Stevenson&rsquo;s is always the better way.&nbsp; He may save you
soiling your fingers; but the real attractiveness of certain
things is inseparable from their uncouthness, their downright
ugliness.&nbsp; Sometimes you feel that a plainer setting would
have shown off the jewel to better advantage.&nbsp; Otherwise one
has nothing but welcome for such memorable figures as John
Silver, the Admiral in <i>The Story of a Lie</i>, Master Francis
Villon, and a goodly company beside.</p>
<p>It is impossible even in such a cursory estimate of Stevenson
as this to pass over his vignettes of Nature.&nbsp; And it is the
more necessary to emphasize these, inasmuch as the
Vagabond&rsquo;s passion for the Earth is clearly discernible in
these pictures.&nbsp; They are no Nature sketches as imagined by
a mere &ldquo;ink-bottle feller&rdquo;&mdash;to use a phrase of
one of Mr. Hardy&rsquo;s rustics.&nbsp; One of Stevenson&rsquo;s
happiest recollections was an &ldquo;open air&rdquo; experience
when he slept on the earth.&nbsp; He loved the <!-- page 134--><a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>largeness
of the open air, and his intense joy in natural sights and sounds
bespeaks the man of fine, even hectic sensibility, whose nerves
quiver for the benison of the winds and sunshine.</p>
<p>Ever since the days of Mrs. Radcliffe, who used the stormier
aspects of Nature with such effect in her stories, down to Mr.
Thomas Hardy, whose massive scenic effects are so remarkable,
Nature has been regarded as a kind of &ldquo;stage
property&rdquo; by the novelist.</p>
<p>To the great writers the Song of the Earth has proved an
inspiration only second to the &ldquo;Song of Songs,&rdquo; and
the lesser writer has imitated as best he could so effective a
decoration.&nbsp; But there is no mistaking the genuine lover of
the Earth.&nbsp; He does not&mdash;as Oscar Wilde wittily said of
a certain popular novelist&mdash;&ldquo;frighten the evening sky
into violent chromo-lithographic effects&rdquo;; he paints the
sunrises and sunsets with a loving fidelity which there is no
mistaking.&nbsp; Nor are all the times and seasons of equal
interest in his eyes.&nbsp; If we look back at the masters of
fiction (ay, and mistresses too) in the past age, we shall note
how each one has his favourite aspect, how each responds more
readily to one special mood of the ancient Earth.</p>
<p>Mention has been made of Mrs. Radcliffe.&nbsp; Extravagant and
absurd as her stories are in many ways, she was a genuine lover
of Nature, especially of its grand and sublime aspects.&nbsp; Her
influence may be traced in Scott, still more in Byron.&nbsp; The
mystic side of Nature finds its lovers chiefly in the poets, in
Coleridge and in Shelley.&nbsp; But at a later date Nathaniel
Hawthorne found in the mysticism of the Earth his finest
inspiration; while <!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>throughout the novels of Charlotte
and Emily Bront&euml; wail the bleak winds of the North, and the
grey storm-clouds are always hurrying past.&nbsp; Even in Dickens
there is more snow than sunshine, and we hear more of &ldquo;the
winds that would be howling at all hours&rdquo; than of the
brooding peace and quiet of summer days.&nbsp; Charles Kingsley
is less partial towards the seasons, and cares less about the
mysticism than the physical influences of Nature.</p>
<p>In our own day Mr. George Meredith has reminded us of the big
geniality of the Earth; and the close relationship of the Earth
and her moods with those who live nearest to her has found a
faithful observer in Mr. Hardy.</p>
<p>Stevenson differs from Meredith and Hardy in this.&nbsp; He
looks at her primarily with the eye of the artist.&nbsp; They
look at her primarily with the eye of the scientific
philosopher.</p>
<p>Here is a twilight effect from <i>The Return of the
Native</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The sombre stretch of rounds and hollows
seemed to rise and meet the evening gloom in pure sympathy, the
heath exhaling darkness as rapidly as the heavens precipitated
it. . . .&nbsp; The place became full of a watchful intentness
now; for when other things sank brooding to sleep, the heath
appeared slowly to awake and listen.&nbsp; Every night its
Titanic form seemed to await something; but it had waited thus
unmoved during so many centuries, through the crises of so many
things, that it could only be imagined to await one last
crisis&mdash;the final overthrow. . . .&nbsp; Twilight combined
with the scenery <!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>of Egdon Heath to evolve a thing
majestic without severity, impressive without showiness, emphatic
in its admonitions, grand in its simplicity.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Contrast with this a twilight piece from Stevenson:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The sky itself was of a ruddy, powerful,
nameless changing colour, dark and glossy like a serpent&rsquo;s
back.&nbsp; The stars by innumerable millions stuck boldly forth
like lamps.&nbsp; The milky way was bright, like a moonlit cloud;
half heaven seemed milky way.&nbsp; The greater luminaries shone
each more clearly than a winter&rsquo;s moon.&nbsp; Their light
was dyed in every sort of colour&mdash;red, like fire; blue, like
steel; green, like the tracks of sunset; and so sharply did each
stand forth in its own lustre that there was no appearance of
that flat, star-spangled arch we know so well in pictures, but
all the hollow of heaven was one chaos of contesting
luminaries&mdash;a hurly-burly of stars.&nbsp; Against this the
hill and rugged tree-tops stood out redly dark.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each passage has a fresh beauty that removes it from the
perfunctory tributes of the ordinary writer.&nbsp; But the
difference between the Artist and the Philosopher is
obvious.&nbsp; Not that Mr. Hardy has no claims as an
artist.&nbsp; Different as their styles are, and although
Stevenson has a more fastidious taste for words, the large,
deliberate, massive art of Hardy is equally effective in its
fashion.&nbsp; That, however, by the way.&nbsp; The point is that
Mr. Hardy never rests <i>as</i> an artist&mdash;he is quite as
concerned with the philosophic as with the pictorial aspects of
the scene.&nbsp; Stevenson rejoices as a Romantic; admires like
an Artist.</p>
<h3><!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>VI</h3>
<p>But if Stevenson does not care to philosophize over
Nature&mdash;herein parting company with Thoreau as well as
Hardy&mdash;he can moralize on occasion, and with infinite relish
too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something of the Shorter Catechist,&rdquo; as his
friend Henley so acutely said.&nbsp; There is the Moralist in his
essays, in some of the short stories&mdash;<i>Jekyll and Hyde</i>
is a morality in disguise, and unblushingly so is <i>A Christmas
Sermon</i>.</p>
<p>Some of his admirers have deplored this tendency in Stevenson;
have shaken their heads gloomily over his Scottish ancestry, and
spoken as apologetically about the moralizing as if it had been
kleptomania.</p>
<p>Well, there it is as glaring and apparent as Borrow&rsquo;s
big green gamp or De Quincey&rsquo;s insularity.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What business has a Vagabond to moralize?&rdquo; asks the
reader.&nbsp; Yet there is a touch of the Moralist in every
Vagabond (especially the English-speaking Vagabond), and its
presence in Stevenson gives an additional piquancy to his
work.&nbsp; The <i>Lay Morals</i> and the <i>Christmas Sermon</i>
may not exhilarate some readers greatly, but there is a fresher
note, a larger utterance in the <i>Fables</i>.&nbsp; And even if
you do not care for Stevenson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Shorter Catechist&rdquo; moods, is it wise, even from the
artistic point of view, to wish away that side of his
temperament?&nbsp; Was it the absence of the &ldquo;Shorter
Catechist&rdquo; in Edgar Allan Poe that sent him drifting
impotently across the world, brilliant, unstable, aspiring, <!--
page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>grovelling; a man of many fine qualities and
extraordinary intensity of imagination, but tragically weak where
he ought to have been strong?&nbsp; And was it the &ldquo;Shorter
Catechist&rdquo; in Stevenson that gave him that grip-hold of
life&rsquo;s possibilities, imbued him with his unfailing
courage, and gave him as Artist a strenuous devotion to an ideal
that accompanied him to the end?&nbsp; Or was it so lamentable a
defect as certain critics allege?&nbsp; I wonder.</p>

<h3><!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>I</h3>
<p>The longing of a full, sensuous nature for fairer dreams of
beauty than come within its ken; the delight of a passionate soul
in the riotous wealth of the Earth, the luxuriant prodigality of
the Earth; the hysterical joy of the invalid in the splendid
sanity of the sunlight&mdash;these are the sentiments that well
up from the writings of Richard Jefferies.</p>
<p>By comparison with him, Thoreau&rsquo;s Earth-worship seems
quite a stolid affair, and even Borrow&rsquo;s frank enjoyment of
the open air has a strangely apathetic touch about it.</p>
<p>No doubt he felt more keenly than did the Hermit of Walden, or
the Norfolk giant, but it was not so much passionate intensity as
nervous susceptibility.&nbsp; He had the sensitive quivering
nerves of the neurotic which respond to the slightest
stimulus.&nbsp; Of all the &ldquo;Children of the Open Air&rdquo;
Jefferies was the most sensitive; but for all that I would not
say that he felt more deeply than Thoreau, Borrow, or
Stevenson.</p>
<p>Some people are especially susceptible by constitution to pain
or pleasure, but it would be rash to assume hastily that on this
account they have more deeply <!-- page 142--><a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>emotional
natures.&nbsp; That they express their feelings more readily is
no guarantee that they feel more deeply.</p>
<p>In other words, there is a difference between susceptibility
and passion.</p>
<p>Whether a man has passion&mdash;be it of love or
hate&mdash;can be judged only by his general attitude towards his
fellow-beings, and by the stability of the emotion.</p>
<p>Now Jefferies certainly had keener sympathies with humankind
than Thoreau, and these sympathies intensified as the years
rolled by.&nbsp; Few men have espoused more warmly the cause of
the agricultural labourer.&nbsp; Perhaps Hodge has never
experienced a kinder advocate than Jefferies.&nbsp; To accuse him
of superficiality of emotion would be unfair; for he was a man
with much natural tenderness in his disposition.</p>
<p>All that I wish to protest against is the assumption made by
some that because he has written so feelingly about Hodge,
because he has shown so quick a response to the beauties of the
natural world, he was therefore gifted with a deep nature, as has
been claimed for him by some of his admirers.</p>
<p>One of the characteristics that differentiates the Vagabond
writer from his fellows is, I think, a lack of
passion&mdash;always excepting a passion for the earth, a quality
lacking human significance.&nbsp; In their human sympathies they
vary: but in no case, not even with Whitman, as I hope to show in
my next paper, is there a <i>passion</i> for humankind.&nbsp;
There may be curiosity about certain types, as with Borrow and
Stevenson; a delight in simple natures, as with Thoreau; a broad,
genial comradeship <!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>with all and sundry, as in the case
of Whitman; but never do you find depth, intensity.</p>
<p>Jefferies then presents to my mind all the characteristics of
the Vagabond, his many graces and charms, his notable
deficiencies, especially the absence of emotional
stability.&nbsp; This trait is, of course, more pronounced in
some Vagabonds than in others; but it belongs to his inmost
being.&nbsp; Eager, curious, adventurous; tasting this experience
and that; his emotions share with his intellect in a chronic
restless transition.&nbsp; More easily felt than defined is the
lack of permanence in his nature; his emotions flame fitfully and
in gusts, rather than with steady persistence.&nbsp; Finally,
despite the tenderness and kindliness he can show, the egotistic
elements absorb too much of his nature.&nbsp; A great egotist can
never be a great lover.</p>
<p>This may seem a singularly ungracious prelude to a
consideration of Richard Jefferies; but whatever it may seem it
is quite consistent with a hearty admiration for his genius, and
a warm appreciation of the man.&nbsp; Passion he had of a kind,
but it was the rapt, self-centred passion of the mystic.</p>
<p>He interests us both as an artist and as a thinker.&nbsp; It
will be useful, therefore, to keep these points of view as
separate as possible in studying his writings.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Looking at him first of all as an artist, the most obvious
thing that strikes a reader is his power to convey <!-- page
144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>sensuous impressions.&nbsp; He loved the Earth, not as
some have done with the eye or ear only, but with every nerve of
his body.&nbsp; His scenic pictures are more glowing, more ardent
than those of Thoreau.&nbsp; There was more of the poet, less of
the naturalist in Jefferies.&nbsp; Perhaps it would have been
juster to call Thoreau a poetic naturalist, and reserved the term
poet-naturalist for Jefferies.&nbsp; Be that as it may, no one
can read Jefferies&mdash;especially such books as <i>Wild Life in
a Southern County</i>, or <i>The Life of the Fields</i>, without
realizing the keen sensibility of the man to the sensuous
impressions of Nature.</p>
<p>Again and again in reading Jefferies one is reminded of the
poet Keats.&nbsp; There is the same physical frailty of
constitution and the same rare susceptibility to every
manifestation of beauty.&nbsp; There is, moreover, the same
intellectual devotion to beauty which made Keats declare Truth
and Beauty to be one.&nbsp; And the likeness goes further
still.</p>
<p>The reader who troubles to compare the sensuous imagery of the
three great Nature poets&mdash;Wordsworth, Shelley, and Keats,
will realize an individual difference in apprehending the
beauties of the natural world.&nbsp; Wordsworth worships with his
ear, Shelley with his eye, Keats with his sense of touch.&nbsp;
Sound, colour, feeling&mdash;these things inform the poetry of
these great poets, and give them their special individual
charm.</p>
<p>Now, in Jefferies it is not so much the colour of life, or the
sweet harmonies of the Earth, that he celebrates, though of
course these things find a place in his prose songs.&nbsp; It is
the &ldquo;glory of the sum of things&rdquo; that diffuses itself
and is felt by every nerve in his body.</p>
<p><!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>Take, for instance, the opening to <i>Wild Life in a
Southern County</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The inner slope of the green fosse is
inclined at an angle pleasant to recline on, with the head just
below the edge, in the summer sunshine.&nbsp; A faint sound as of
a sea heard in a dream&mdash;a sibilant
&ldquo;sish-sish&rdquo;&mdash;passes along outside, dying away
and coming again as a fresh wave of the wind rushes through the
bennets and the dry grass.&nbsp; There is the happy hum of
bees&mdash;who love the hills&mdash;as they speed by laden with
their golden harvest, a drowsy warmth, and the delicious odour of
wild thyme.&nbsp; Behind, the fosse sinks and the rampart rises
high and steep&mdash;two butterflies are wheeling in uncertain
flight over the summit.&nbsp; It is only necessary to raise the
head a little way, and the cod breeze refreshes the
cheek&mdash;cool at this height, while the plains beneath glow
under the heat.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, too, from <i>The Life of the Fields</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Green rushes, long and thick, standing up
above the edge of the ditch, told the hour of the year, as
distinctly as the shadow on the dial the hour of the day.&nbsp;
Green and thick and sappy to the touch, they felt like summer,
soft and elastic, as if full of life, mere rushes though they
were.&nbsp; On the fingers they left a green scent; rushes have a
separate scent of green, so, too, have ferns very different to
that of grass or leaves.&nbsp; Rising from brown sheaths, the
tall stems, enlarged a little in the middle like classical
columns, and heavy with their sap and freshness, leaned against
the hawthorn sprays.&nbsp; From the earth they had drawn its
moisture, and made the ditch dry; some of the sweetness <!-- page
146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>of
the air had entered into their fibres, and the rushes&mdash;the
common rushes&mdash;were full of beautiful summer.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jefferies&rsquo; writings are studies in tactile
sensation.&nbsp; This is what brings him into affinity with
Keats, and this is what differentiates him from Thoreau, with
whom he had much in common.&nbsp; Of both Jefferies and Thoreau
it might be said what Emerson said of his friend, that they
&ldquo;saw as with a microscope, heard as with an
ear-trumpet.&rdquo;&nbsp; As lovers of the open air and of the
life of the open air, every sense was preternaturally
quickened.&nbsp; But though both observed acutely, Jefferies
alone felt acutely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To me,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;colour is a sort of food;
every spot of colour is a drop of wine to the spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took many years for him to realize where exactly his
strength as a writer lay.&nbsp; In early and later life he again
and again essayed the novel form, but, superior as were his later
fictions&mdash;<i>Amaryllis at the Fair</i>, for instance, to
such crude stuff as <i>The Scarlet Shawl</i>&mdash;it is as a
prose Nature poet that he will be remembered.</p>
<p>He knew and loved the Earth; the atmosphere of the country
brought into play all the faculties of his nature.&nbsp; Lacking
in social gifts, reserved and shy to an extreme, he neither knew
much about men and women, nor cared to know much.&nbsp; With a
few exceptions&mdash;for the most part studies of his own kith
and kin&mdash;the personages of his stories are shadow people;
less vital realities than the trees, the flowers, the birds, of
whom he has to speak.</p>
<p>But where he writes of what he has felt, what he has

</a><!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>realized, then, like every fine
artist, he transmits his enthusiasm to others.&nbsp; Sometimes,
maybe, he is so full of his subject, so engrossed with the
wonders of the Earth, that the words come forth in a torrent,
impetuous, overwhelming.&nbsp; He writes like a man beside
himself with sheer joy.&nbsp; <i>The Life of the Fields</i> gives
more than physical pleasure, more than an imaginative delight, it
is a religion&mdash;the old religion of Paganism.&nbsp; He has,
as Sir Walter Besant truly said, &ldquo;communed so much with
Nature, that he is intoxicated with her fulness and her
beauty.&nbsp; He lies upon the turf, and feels the embrace of the
great round world.&rdquo; <a name="citation147"></a><a
href="#footnote147" class="citation">[147]</a></p>
<p>Even apart from fiction, his earlier work varied greatly in
quality.&nbsp; With the publication of <i>The Game-keeper at
Home</i>, it was clear that a new force had entered English
literature.&nbsp; A man of temperamental sympathies with men like
Borrow and Thoreau, nevertheless with a power and individuality
of his own.&nbsp; But if increasing years brought comparative
recognition, they brought also fresh physical infirmities.&nbsp;
The last few years of his life were one prolonged agony, and yet
his finest work was done in them, and that splendid prose-poem,
&ldquo;The Pageant of Summer,&rdquo; was dictated in the direst
possible pain.&nbsp; As the physical frame grew weaker the
passion for the Earth grew in intensity; and in his writing there
is all that desperate longing for the great healing forces of
Nature, that ecstasy in the glorious freedom of the open air,
characteristic of the sick man.</p>
<p>At its best Jefferies&rsquo; style is rich in sensuous charm,
<!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>and remarkable no less for its eloquence of thought
than for its wealth of observation.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>One characteristic of his art is of especial interest; I mean
the mystical quality which he imparts to certain of his
descriptions of Nature.&nbsp; The power of mystic suggestion is a
rare one; even poets like Keats and Shelley could not always
command it successfully&mdash;and perhaps Blake, Coleridge, and
Rossetti alone of our poets possessed it in the highest
degree.&nbsp; It is comparatively an easy matter to deal with the
mysticism of the night.&nbsp; The possibilities of darkness
readily impress the imagination.&nbsp; But the mysticism of the
sunlight&mdash;the mysticism not of strange shapes, but of
familiar things of every day, this, though felt by many, is the
most difficult thing in the world to suggest in words.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;visions&rdquo; of Jefferies, his moods of emotional
exaltation, recall not only the opium dream of De Quincey, but
the ecstasies of the old Mystics.&nbsp; The theological colouring
is not present, but there is the same sharpened condition of the
senses, the same spiritual hunger for a fuller life, the same
sense of physical detachment from the body.</p>
<p>In that fascinating volume of autobiography <i>The Story of my
Heart</i>, Jefferies gives many remarkable instances of these
visions.&nbsp; Here is one:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I looked at the hills, at the dewy grass,
and then up <!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>through the elm branches to the
sky.&nbsp; In a moment all that was behind me&mdash;the house,
the people, the sound&mdash;seemed to disappear and to leave me
alone.&nbsp; Involuntarily I drew a long breath, then I breathed
slowly.&nbsp; My thought, or inner conscience, went up through
the illumined sky, and I was lost in a moment of
exaltation.&nbsp; This lasted only a very short time, only a part
of a second, and while it lasted there was no formulated
wish.&nbsp; I was absorbed.&nbsp; I drank the beauty of the
morning.&nbsp; I was exalted.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One is reminded of Tennyson&rsquo;s verses:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Moreover, something is or seems,<br />
That touches me with mystic gleams,<br />
Like glimpses of forgotten dreams&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of something felt, like something here;<br />
Of something done, I know not where;<br />
Such as no knowledge may declare.&rdquo; <a
name="citation149"></a><a href="#footnote149"
class="citation">[149]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; says the medical man, with a wise shake of
the head, &ldquo;this mental condition is a common enough
phenomenon, though only on rare occasions does it express itself
in literature.&nbsp; It is simple hysteria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The transcendentalist who has regarded this state of mind as a
spiritual revelation, and looked upon its possessor as one
endowed with special powers of intuition, is indignant with this
physiological explanation.&nbsp; He is more indignant when the
medical man proceeds to explain the ecstatic trances of saints,
those whom one may call professional mystics.&nbsp; &ldquo;Brutal
materialism,&rdquo; says the transcendentalist.</p>
<p><!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>Now although hysteria is commonly regarded as a foolish
exhibition of weakness on the part of some excitable men and
women, there is absolutely no scientific reason why any stigma
should attach to this phenomenon.&nbsp; Nor is there any reason
why the explanation should be considered as derogatory and
necessarily connected with a materialistic view of the
Universe.</p>
<p>For what is hysteria?&nbsp; It is an abnormal condition of the
nervous system giving rise to certain physiological and psychical
manifestations.&nbsp; With the physiological ones we are not
concerned, but the psychical manifestation should be of the
greatest interest to all students of literature who are also
presumably students of life.&nbsp; The artistic temperament is
always associated with a measure of nervous instability.&nbsp;
And where there is nervous instability there will always be a
tendency to hysteria.&nbsp; This tendency may be kept in check by
other faculties.&nbsp; But it is latent&mdash;ready to manifest
itself in certain conditions of health or under special stress of
excitement.&nbsp; It does not follow that every hysterical person
has the artistic temperament; for nervous instability may be the
outcome of nervous disease, epilepsy, insanity, or even simple
neuroticism in the parents.&nbsp; But so powerful is the
influence of the imagination over the body, that the vivid
imagination connoted by the artistic temperament controls the
nervous system, and when it reaches a certain intensity expresses
itself in some abnormal way.&nbsp; And it is the abnormal
psychical condition that is of so much significance in literature
and philosophy.</p>
<p>This psychical condition is far commoner in the East <!-- page
151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>than in the West.&nbsp; Indeed in India, training in
mystical insight goes by the name of Yoga. <a
name="citation151a"></a><a href="#footnote151a"
class="citation">[151a]</a>&nbsp; The passive, contemplative
temperament of the Oriental favours this ecstatic condition.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The science of the Sufis,&rdquo; says a
Persian philosopher of the eleventh century, <a
name="citation151b"></a><a href="#footnote151b"
class="citation">[151b]</a> &ldquo;aims at detaching the heart
from all that is not God, and at giving to it for sole occupation
the meditation of the divine being. . . .&nbsp; Just as the
understanding is a stage of human life in which an eye opens to
discuss various intellectual objects uncomprehended by sensation;
just so in the prophetic the sight is illumined by a light which
uncovers hidden things and objects which the intellect fails to
reach.&nbsp; The chief properties of prophetism are perceptible
only during the transport by those who embrace the Sufi
life.&nbsp; The prophet is endowed with qualities to which you
possess nothing analogous, and which consequently you cannot
possibly understand.&nbsp; How should you know their true
nature?&mdash;what one can comprehend?&nbsp; But the transport
which one attains by the method of the Sufis is like an immediate
perception, as if one touched the objects with one&rsquo;s
hand.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is worthy of note how that every ecstatic condition is
marked by the same characteristics; and in the confession of
Jefferies, the admissions of Tennyson, and in the utterance of
religious mystics of every kind, two factors detach
themselves.&nbsp; The vision or state of mind <!-- page 152--><a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>is one of
expectant wonder.&nbsp; Something that cannot be communicated in
words thrills the entire being.&nbsp; That is one
characteristic.&nbsp; The other is that this exaltation, this
revelation to the senses, is one that appeals wholly to
sensation.&nbsp; It can be felt; it cannot be apprehended by any
intellectual formul&aelig;.&nbsp; It can never be reduced to
logical shape.&nbsp; And the reference to &ldquo;touch&rdquo; in
the quotation just made will remind the reader of the important
part played by the tactile sense in Jefferies&rsquo;
&aelig;sthetic appreciations.</p>
<p>We are not concerned here with any of the philosophical
speculations involved in these &ldquo;trance
conditions.&rdquo;&nbsp; All that concerns us is the remarkable
literature that has resulted from this well-ascertained psychical
condition.&nbsp; How far the condition is the outcome of forces
beyond our immediate ken which compel recognition from certain
imaginative minds, how far it is a question of physical
disturbance; or, in other words, how far these visions are
objective realities, how far subjective, are questions that he
beyond the scope of the present paper.&nbsp; One thing, however,
is indisputable; they have exercised a great fascination over men
of sensitive, nervous temperaments, and are often remarkable for
the wider significance they have given to our ideals of
beauty.</p>
<p>The fact that mysticism may arise out of morbid conditions of
health does not justify us, I think, in looking upon it with Max
Nordau as &ldquo;the fruit of a degenerate brain.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Such a criticism is at one with the linking of genius with
insanity&mdash;an argument already broached in the paper dealing
with Hazlitt.</p>
<p><!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>Professor William James&mdash;who certainly holds no
brief for the mystic&mdash;makes the interesting suggestion that
&ldquo;these mystical flights are inroads from the subconscious
life of the cerebral activity, correlative to which we as yet
know nothing.&rdquo; <a name="citation153a"></a><a
href="#footnote153a" class="citation">[153a]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As a rule,&rdquo; he says elsewhere,
&ldquo;mystical states merely add a super-sensuous meaning to the
ordinary outward data of consciousness.&nbsp; They are
excitements like the emotions of love or ambition, gifts to our
spirit by means of which facts already objectively before us fall
into a new expressiveness, and make a new connection with our
active life.&nbsp; They do not contradict these facts as such, or
deny anything that our senses have immediately seized.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The connection between mysticism and hysteria, and the
psychological importance of hysteria, merits the fullest
consideration in dealing with the writings of these literary
Vagabonds.&nbsp; Stevenson&rsquo;s mysticism is more speculative
than that of Jefferies; the intellectual life played a greater
share in his case, but it is none the less marked; and quite
apart from, perhaps even transcending, their literary interest is
the psychological significance of stories like <i>Markheim</i>
and <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i>.</p>
<p>A medical friend of Jefferies, Dr. Samuel Jones, <a
name="citation153b"></a><a href="#footnote153b"
class="citation">[153b]</a> has said, when speaking of his
&ldquo;ecstasies&rdquo;: &ldquo;His is not the baneful, sensuous
De Quincey opium-deliriation; he felt a purer delight than that
which inspired the visions of Kubla Khan; he saw &lsquo;no damsel
with a dulcimer,&rsquo; <!-- page 154--><a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>but
thrilled with yearning unspeakable for the &lsquo;fuller
soul,&rsquo; and felt in every trembling fibre of his frame the
consciousness of incarnate immortality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This attempt to exalt Jefferies at the expense of De Quincey
and Coleridge seems to me unfortunate.&nbsp; Enough has been said
already in the remarks on De Quincey to show that the dreams of
De Quincey were no mere opium dreams.&nbsp; De Quincey was a born
dreamer, and from his earliest days had visions and ecstatic
moods.&nbsp; The opium which he took (primarily at any rate to
relieve pain, not, as Dr. Jones suggests, to excite sensuous
imagery) undoubtedly intensified the dream faculty, but it did
not produce it.</p>
<p>I confess that I do not know quite what the Doctor means by
preferring the &ldquo;purer delight&rdquo; of the Jefferies
exaltation to the vision that produced <i>Kubla Khan</i>.&nbsp;
If he implies that opium provoked the one and that &ldquo;the
pure breath of Nature&rdquo; (to use his own phrase) inspired the
other, and that the latter consequently is the purer delight,
then I cannot follow his reasoning.</p>
<p>A vision is not the less &ldquo;pure&rdquo; because it has
been occasioned by a drug.&nbsp; One of the sublimest spiritual
experiences that ever happened to a man came to John Addington
Symonds after a dose of chloroform.&nbsp; Nitrous oxide, ether,
Indian hemp, opium, these things have been the means of arousing
the most wonderful states of ecstatic feeling.</p>
<p>Then why should <i>Kubla Khan</i> be rated as a less
&ldquo;pure&rdquo; delight than one of the experiences retailed
in <i>The Story of my Heart</i>?&nbsp; Is our imagination so
restricted <!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>that it cannot enjoy both the
subtleties of Coleridge and the fuller muse of Jefferies?</p>
<p>The healing power of Nature has never found happier expression
than in <i>The Story of my Heart</i>.&nbsp; In words of simple
eloquence he tells us how he cured the weariness and bitterness
of spirit by a journey to the seashore.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The inner nature was faint, all was dry and
tasteless; I was weary for the pure fresh springs of
thought.&nbsp; Some instinctive feeling uncontrollable drove me
to the sea. . . .&nbsp; Then alone I went down to the sea.&nbsp;
I stood where the foam came to my feet, and looked out over the
sunlit waters.&nbsp; The great earth bearing the richness of the
harvest, and its hills golden with corn, was at my back; its
strength and firmness under me.&nbsp; The great sun shone above,
the wide sea was before me.&nbsp; The wind came sweet and strong
from the waves.&nbsp; The life of the earth and the sea, the glow
of the sun filled me; I touched the surge with my hand, I lifted
my face to the sun, I opened my lips to the wind.&nbsp; I prayed
aloud in the roar of the waves&mdash;my soul was strong as the
sea, and prayed with the sea&rsquo;s might.&nbsp; Give me fulness
of life like to the sea and the sun, and to the earth and the
air; give me fulness of physical life, mind equal and beyond
their fulness; give me a greatness and perfection of soul higher
than all things; give me my inexpressible desire which swells in
me like a tide&mdash;give it to me with all the force of the
sea.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those who know Jefferies only by his quieter passages of
leisurely observation are surprised when they find such a swirl
of passionate longing in his autobiography.</p>
<h3><!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>IV</h3>
<p>The points of affinity between Thoreau and Jefferies are
sufficiently obvious; and yet no two writers who have loved the
Earth, and found their greatest happiness in the life of the
woods and fields, as did these two men, have expressed this
feeling so variously.&nbsp; Thoreau, quiet, passive,
self-contained, has seized upon the large tranquillity of Nature,
the coolness and calm, &ldquo;the central piece subsisting at the
heart of endless agitation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Interspersed with his
freshly observed comments on the myriad life about him are moral
reflections, shrewd criticism of men and things, quaint and
curious illustrations from his scholarly knowledge.&nbsp; But
although he may not always talk of the Earth, there is the
flavour of the Earth, the sweetness and naturalness of the Earth,
about his finest utterances.</p>
<p>Jefferies, feverish, excitable, passionate, alive to the
glorious plenitude of the Earth, has seized upon the exceeding
beauty, and the healing beauty of natural things.&nbsp; No
scholar like Thoreau, he brings no system of thought, as did the
American, for Nature to put into shape.&nbsp; Outside of Nature
all is arid and profitless to him.&nbsp; He comes to her with
empty hands, and seeks for what she may give him.&nbsp; To
Thoreau the Earth was a kind and gracious sister; to Jefferies an
all-sufficing mistress.</p>
<p>The reader who passes from Thoreau to Jefferies need have no
fear that he will be wearied with the same point of view.&nbsp;
On the contrary, he will realize with <!-- page 157--><a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>pleasure
how differently two genuine lovers of the Earth can express their
affection.</p>
<p>In Jefferies&rsquo; song of praise, his song of
desire&mdash;praise and desire alternate continually in his
writings&mdash;there are two aspects of the Earth upon which he
dwells continually&mdash;the exceeding beauty of the Earth, and
the exceeding plenitude of the Earth.&nbsp; Apostrophes to the
beauty have been quoted already; let this serve as an
illustration of the other aspect:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; <a
name="citation157a"></a><a href="#footnote157a"
class="citation">[157a]</a> he exclaims, &ldquo;on a scale of
splendid waste.&nbsp; Such noble broadcast, open-armed waste is
delicious to behold.&nbsp; Never was there such a lying proverb
as &lsquo;Enough is as good as a feast.&rsquo; <a
name="citation157b"></a><a href="#footnote157b"
class="citation">[157b]</a>&nbsp; Give me the feast; give me
squandered millions of seeds, luxurious carpets of petals, green
mountains of oak leaves.&nbsp; The greater the waste the greater
the enjoyment&mdash;the nearer the approach to real life.&nbsp;
Casuistry is of no avail; the fact is obvious; Nature flings
treasures abroad, puffs them with open lips along on every
breeze; piles up lavish layers of them in the free, open air,
packs countless numbers together in the needles of a fir
tree.&nbsp; Prodigality and superfluity are stamped on everything
she does.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is no chance passage, no casual thought.&nbsp; Again and
again Jefferies returns to the richness and plenty of the
Earth.&nbsp; And his style, suiting itself to the man&rsquo;s
temperament, is rich and overflowing, splendidly diffuse, <!--
page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>riotously exulting, until at times there is the very
incoherence of passion about it.</p>
<p>Thus, in looking at the man&rsquo;s artistic work, its form of
expression, its characteristic notes, something of the
man&rsquo;s way of thinking has impressed itself upon us.</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p>It may be well to gather up the scattered impressions, and to
look at the thought that underlies his fervid utterances.&nbsp;
Beginning as merely an interested observer of Nature, his
attitude becomes more enthusiastic, as knowledge grows of her
ways, and what began in observation ends in aspiration.&nbsp; The
old cry, &ldquo;Return to Nature,&rdquo; started by Rousseau,
caught by the poets of the &ldquo;Romantic Revival&rdquo; in
England, and echoed by the essayists of New England, fell into
silence about the middle of last century.&nbsp; It had inspired a
splendid group of Nature poets; and for a time it was felt some
new gospel was needed.&nbsp; Scientific and philosophical
problems took possession of men&rsquo;s minds; the intellectual
and emotional life of the nation centred more and more round the
life of the city.&nbsp; For a time this was, perhaps,
inevitable.&nbsp; For a time Nature regarded through the eyes of
fresh scientific thought had lost her charm.&nbsp; Even the poets
who once had been content to worship, now began to
criticize.&nbsp; Tennyson qualified his homage with
reproachings.&nbsp; Arnold carried his books of philosophy into
her presence.&nbsp; But at last men tired of this questioning
attitude.&nbsp; America produced <!-- page 159--><a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>a Whitman;
and in England William Morris and Richard Jefferies&mdash;among
others&mdash;cried out for a simpler, freer, more childlike
attitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All things seem possible,&rdquo; declared Jefferies,
&ldquo;in the open air.&rdquo;&nbsp; To live according to Nature
was, he assured his countrymen, no poet&rsquo;s fancy, but a
creed of life.&nbsp; He spoke from his own experience; life in
the open, tasting the wild sweetness of the Earth, had brought
him his deepest happiness; and he cried aloud in his exultation,
bidding others do likewise.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you wish your
children,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;to think deep things, to know
the holiest emotions, take them to the woods and hills, and give
them the freedom of the meadows.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the futility of
bookish learning, the ugliness and sordidness of town life, he is
always discoursing.&nbsp; His themes were not fresh ones; every
reformer, every prophet of the age had preached from the same
text.&nbsp; And none had put the case for Nature more forcibly
than Wordsworth when he lamented&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The world is too much with us.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the plea for saner ways of living cannot be urged too
often, and if Jefferies in his enthusiasm exaggerates the other
side of the picture, pins his faith over much on solitudes and in
self-communion, too little on the gregarious instincts of
humankind, yet no reformer can make any impression on his fellows
save by a splendid one-sidedness.</p>
<p>The defect of his Nature creed which calls for the most
serious criticism is not the personal isolation on which he seems
to insist.&nbsp; We herd together so much&mdash;<!-- page
160--><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>some unhappily by necessity, some by choice, that it
would be a refreshing thing, and a wholesome thing, for most of
us to be alone, more often face to face with the primal forces of
Nature.</p>
<p>The serious defect in his thought seems to me to lie in his
attitude towards the animal creation.&nbsp; It is summed up in
his remark: &ldquo;There is nothing human in any living
Animal.&nbsp; All Nature, the Universe as far as we see, is anti-
or ultra-human outside, and has no concern with man.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In this statement he shows how entirely he has failed to grasp
the secret of the compelling power of the Earth&mdash;a secret
into which Thoreau entered so fully.</p>
<p>Why should the elemental forces of Nature appeal so strongly
to us?&nbsp; Why does the dweller in the open air feel that an
unseen bond of sympathy binds him to the lowest forms of sentient
life?&nbsp; Why is a St. Francis tender towards animals?&nbsp;
Why does a Thoreau take a joy in the company of the birds, the
squirrels, and feel a sense of companionship in the very
flowers?&nbsp; Nay, more: what is it that gives a Jefferies this
sense of communion? why, if the Earth has no &ldquo;concern with
man,&rdquo; should it soothe with its benison, and fire his being
with such ecstatic rapture?&nbsp; If this doctrine of a Universal
Brotherhood is a sentimental figment, the foundation is swept
away at once of Jefferies&rsquo; Nature creed.&nbsp; His sense of
happiness, his delight in the Earth, may no doubt afford him
consolation, but it is an irrational comfort, an agreeable
delusion.</p>
<p>And yet no one can read a book of Jefferies without realizing
that here is no sickly fancy&mdash;however sickness <!-- page
161--><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>may have imparted a hectic colouring here and
there&mdash;but that the instinct of the Artist is more reliable
than the theory of the Thinker.&nbsp; Undoubtedly his Nature
creed is less comprehensive than Thoreau&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Jefferies
regarded many animals as &ldquo;good sport&rdquo;; Thoreau as
good friends.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hares,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;are
almost formed on purpose to be good sport.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
remark speaks volumes.&nbsp; A man who could say that has but a
poor philosophic defence to offer for his rapt communion with
Nature.</p>
<p>How can you have communion with something &ldquo;anti- or
ultra-human&rdquo;?&nbsp; The large utterance, &ldquo;All things
seem possible in the open air&rdquo; dwindles down rather meanly
when the speaker looks at animals from the sportsman&rsquo;s
point of view.&nbsp; Against his want of sympathy with the lower
forms of creation one must put his warm-hearted plea for the
agricultural poor.&nbsp; In his youth there was a certain harsh
intolerance about his attitude towards his fellows, but he made
ample amends in <i>Hodge and his Master</i>, still more in <i>The
Dewy Morn</i>, for the narrow individualism of his earlier
years.</p>
<p>One might criticize certain expressions as extravagant when he
lashed out against the inequalities in society.&nbsp; But after
all there is only a healthy Vagabond flavour about his fling at
&ldquo;modern civilization,&rdquo; and the genuine humanitarian
feeling is very welcome.&nbsp; Some of his unpublished
&ldquo;Notes on the Labour Question&rdquo; (quoted by Mr. Salt in
his able study of Jefferies) are worthy of Ruskin.&nbsp; This,
for instance, is vigorously put:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;But they are paid to
do it,&rsquo; says Comfortable Respectability (which hates
anything in the shape of a &lsquo;question,&rsquo; glad to slur
it over somehow).&nbsp; They are paid to do it.&nbsp; Go down
into the pit yourself, Comfortable Respectability, and try it, as
I have done, just one hour of a summer&rsquo;s day, then you will
know the preciousness of a vulgar pot of beer!&nbsp; Three and
sixpence a day is the price of these brawny muscles, the price of
the rascally sherry you parade before your guests in such
pseudo-generous profusion.&nbsp; One guinea a week&mdash;that is
one stall at the Opera.&nbsp; But why do they do it?&nbsp;
Because Hunger and Thirst drive them.&nbsp; These are the fearful
scourges, the whips worse than the knout, which lie at the back
of Capital, and give it its power.&nbsp; Do you suppose these
human beings, with minds, and souls, and feelings, would not
otherwise repose on the sweet sward, and hearken to the
song-birds as you may do on your lawn at Cedar Villa?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really the passage might have come out of <i>Fors
Clavigera</i>; it is Ruskinian not only in sentiment, but in turn
of expression.&nbsp; Ruskin impressed Jefferies very
considerably, one would gather, and did much to open up his mind
and broaden his sympathies.&nbsp; Making allowance for certain
inconsistencies of mood, hope for and faith in the future, and
weary scepticism, there is a fine stoicism about the philosophy
of Jefferies.&nbsp; His was not the temperament of which
optimists are made.&nbsp; His own terrible ill-health rendered
him keenly sensitive to the pain and misery of the world.&nbsp;
His deliberate seclusion from his fellow-men&mdash;more complete
in some ways than Thoreau&rsquo;s, though not so
ostensible&mdash;threw <!-- page 163--><a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>him back
upon his own thoughts, made him morbidly introspective.</p>
<p>Then the &aelig;sthetic Idealism which dominated him made for
melancholy, as it invariably does.&nbsp; The Worshipper at the
shrine of Beauty is always conscious that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;. . . . In the very temple of Delight<br />
Veiled Melancholy has her sovran shrine.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He realizes the tragic ineffectuality of his
aspiration&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The desire of the moth for the
star,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as Shelley expresses it, and in this line of poetry the mood
finds imperishable expression.</p>
<p>But the melancholy that visits the Idealist&mdash;the
Worshipper of Beauty&mdash;is not by any means a mood of
despair.&nbsp; The moth may not attain the star, but it feels
there is a star to be attained.&nbsp; In other words, an intimate
sense of the beauty of the world carries within it, however
faintly, however overlaid with sick longing, a secret hope that
some day things will shape themselves all right.</p>
<p>And thus it is that every Idealist, bleak and wintry as his
mood may be, is conscious of the latency of spring.&nbsp; Every
Idealist, like the man in the immortal allegory of Bunyan, has a
key in his bosom called Promise.&nbsp; This it is that keeps from
madness.&nbsp; And so while Jefferies will exclaim:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The whole and the worst the pessimist can
say is far beneath the least particle of the truth, so immense is
the misery of man.&rdquo;&nbsp; He will also declare,
&ldquo;There lives on in me an impenetrable belief, thought
burning <!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>like the sun, that there is yet
something to be found, something real, something to give each
separate personality sunshine and flowers in its own existence
now.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a mistake to attach much importance to Jefferies&rsquo;
attempts to systematize his views on life.&nbsp; He lacked the
power of co-ordinating his impressions, and is at his best when
giving free play to the instinctive life within him.&nbsp; No
Vagabond writer can excel him in the expression of feeling; and
yet perhaps no writer is less able than he to account for, to
give a rational explanation of his feelings.&nbsp; He is rarely
satisfactory when he begins to explain.&nbsp; Thoreau&rsquo;s
lines about himself seem to me peculiarly applicable to
Jefferies:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am a parcel of vain strivings tied<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By a chance bond together,<br />
Dangling this way and that, their links<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were made so loose and wide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Methinks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For milder weather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bunch of violets without their roots<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sorrel intermixed,<br />
Encircled by a wisp of straw<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Once coiled about their shoots,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The law<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By which I&rsquo;m fixed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some tender buds were left upon my stem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In mimicry of life,<br />
But ah, the children will not know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till Time has withered them,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With which they&rsquo;re
rife.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jefferies was a brave man, with a rare supply of resolution
and patience.&nbsp; His life was one long struggle <!-- page
165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>against overwhelming odds.&nbsp; &ldquo;Three great
giants,&rdquo; as he puts it&mdash;&ldquo;disease, despair, and
poverty.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not only was his physical health against
him, but his very idiosyncrasies all conspired to hinder his
success.&nbsp; His pride and reserve would not permit him to take
help from his friends.&nbsp; He even shrank from their
sympathy.&nbsp; His years of isolation, voluntary isolation, put
him out of touch with human society.&nbsp; His socialistic
tendencies never made him social.&nbsp; His was a kind of
abstract humanitarianism.&nbsp; A man may feel tenderly,
sympathize towards humanity, yet shrink from human beings.&nbsp;
Misanthropy did not inspire him; he did not dislike his
fellow-men; it was simply that they bewildered and puzzled him;
he could not get on with them.&nbsp; So it will be seen that he
had not the consolation some men take in the sympathy and
co-operation of their fellows.&nbsp; After all, this is more a
defect of temperament than a fault of character, and he had to
pay the penalty.&nbsp; Realizing this, it is impossible to
withhold admiration for the pluck and courage of the man.&nbsp;
As a lover of Nature, and an artist in prose, he needs no
encomium to-day.&nbsp; In his eloquent &ldquo;Eulogy&rdquo; Sir
Walter Besant gave fitting expression to the debt of gratitude we
owe this poet-naturalist&mdash;this passionate interpreter of
English country life.</p>
<p>What Borrow achieved for the stirring life of the road,
Jefferies has done for the brooding life of the fields.&nbsp;
What Thoreau did for the woods at Maine and the waters of
Merrimac, Jefferies did for the Wiltshire streams and the Sussex
hedgerows.&nbsp; He has invested the familiar scenery of Southern
England with a new <!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>glamour, a tenderer sanctity; has
arrested our indifferent vision, our careless hearing, turned our
languid appreciation into a comprehending affection.</p>
<p>Ardent, shy, impressionable, proud, stout-hearted pagan and
wistful idealist; one of the most pathetic and most interesting
figures in modern literature.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;good gray poet&rdquo; is the supreme example of the
Vagabond in literature.&nbsp; It is quite possible for one not
drawn towards the Vagabond temperament to admire Stevenson, for
Stevenson was a fine artist; to take delight in the vigorous
&ldquo;John Bullism&rdquo; of <i>Lavengro</i>; to sympathize with
the natural mysticism of Jefferies; the Puritan austerity of
Thoreau.&nbsp; In short, there are aspects in the writings of the
other &ldquo;Vagabonds&rdquo; in this volume which command
attention quite apart from the characteristics specifically
belonging to the literary Vagabond.</p>
<p>But it is not possible to view Whitman apart from his
Vagabondage.&nbsp; He is proud of it, glories in it, and flings
it in your face.&nbsp; Others, whatever strain of wildness they
may have had, whatever sympathies they may have felt for the
rough sweetness of the earth, however unconventional their
habits, accepted at any rate the recognized conventions of
literature.&nbsp; As men, as thinkers, they were unconventional;
as artists conventional.&nbsp; They retained at any rate the
literary garments of civilized society.</p>
<p>Not so Whitman.&nbsp; He is the Orson of literature.&nbsp;
<!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>Unconventionality he carries out to its logical
conclusion, and strides stark naked among our academies of
learning.&nbsp; A strange, uncouth, surprising figure, it is
impossible to ignore him however much he may shock our
susceptibilities.</p>
<p>Many years ago Mr. Swinburne greeted him as &ldquo;a
strong-winged soul with prophetic wings&rdquo;; subsequently he
referred to him as a &ldquo;drunken apple-woman reeling in a
gutter.&rdquo;&nbsp; For this right-about-face he has been
upbraided by Whitman&rsquo;s admirers.&nbsp; Certainly it is
unusual to find any reader starting out to bless and ending with
a curse.&nbsp; Usually it is the precedent of Balaam that is
followed.&nbsp; But Mr. Swinburne&rsquo;s mingled feelings typify
the attitude of every one who approaches the poet, though few of
us can express ourselves so resourcefully as the author of
<i>Poems and Ballads</i>.</p>
<p>There may be some students who accept Whitman without demur at
the outset on his own terms.&nbsp; All I can say is that I never
heard of one.&nbsp; However broad-minded you may consider
yourself, however catholic in your sympathies, Whitman is bound
to get athwart some pet prejudice, to discover some shred of
conventionality.&nbsp; Gaily, heedlessly, you start out to
explore his writings, just as you might start on a walking
tour.&nbsp; He is in touch with the primal forces of Nature, you
hear.&nbsp; &ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; say you;
&ldquo;civilization has ceased to charm.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You
are enamoured of wildness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus men talk before
camping out, captivated by the picturesque and healthy
possibilities, and oblivious to the inconveniences of roughing
it.</p>
<p><!-- page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>But just as some amount of training is wanted before a
walking tour, or a period of camping out, so is it necessary to
prepare yourself for a course of Whitman.&nbsp; And this, not
because there is any exotic mystery about Whitman, not because
there are any intellectual subtleties about his work, as there
are in Browning, but because he is the pioneer of a new order,
and the pioneer always challenges the old order; our tastes
require adjusting before they can value it properly.</p>
<p>There is no question about a &ldquo;Return to Nature&rdquo;
with Whitman.&nbsp; He never left it.&nbsp; Thoreau quitted the
Emersonian study to get fresh inspiration from the woods.&nbsp;
Even Jefferies, bred up in the country, carried about with him
the delicate susceptibilities of the neurotic modern.&nbsp;
Borrow retained a firm grip-hold of many conventions of the
city.&nbsp; But Whitman?&nbsp; It was no case with him of a
sojourn in the woods, or a ramble on the heath.&nbsp; He was a
spiritual native of the woods and heath; not, as some seem to
think, because he was a kind of wild barbarian who loved the
rough and uncouth, and could be found only in unfrequented parts,
but because he was in touch with the elemental everywhere.&nbsp;
The wildness of Whitman, the barbarian aspects of the man, have
been overrated.&nbsp; He is wild only in so far as he is cosmic,
and the greater contains the less.&nbsp; He loves the rough and
the smooth, not merely the rough.&nbsp; His songs are no mere
p&aelig;ans of rustic solitudes; they are songs of the crowded
streets, as well of the country roads; of men and women&mdash;of
every type&mdash;no less than of the fields and the
streams.&nbsp; In fact, he seeks the elemental everywhere.&nbsp;
<!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>Thoreau found it in the Indian, Borrow in the gypsies,
Whitman, with a finer comprehensiveness, finds it in the
multitude.&nbsp; His business is to bring it to the surface, to
make men and women rejoice in&mdash;not shrink from&mdash;the
great primal forces of life.&nbsp; But he is not for
moralizing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I give nothing as duties,<br />
What others give as duties I give as loving impulses.<br />
(Shall I give the heart&rsquo;s action as a duty?)&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He has no quarrel with civilization as such.&nbsp; The teeming
life of the town is as wonderful to him as the big solitude of
the Earth.&nbsp; Carlyle&rsquo;s pleasantry about the communistic
experiments of the American Transcendentalists would have no
application for him.&nbsp; &ldquo;A return to Acorns and
expecting the Golden Age to arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here is no exclusive child of Nature:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I tramp a perpetual
journey, . . .<br />
My signs are a rainproof coat, good shoes, and a staff cut from
the woods . . .<br />
I have no chair, no church, no philosophy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People talk of Whitman as if he relied entirely on the
&ldquo;staff cut from the woods&rdquo;; they forget his rainproof
coat and good shoes.&nbsp; Assuredly he has no mind to cut
himself adrift from the advantages of civilization.</p>
<p>The rainproof coat, indeed, reminds one of Borrow&rsquo;s
green gamp, which caused such distress to his friends and raised
doubts in the minds of Mr. Watts-Dunton and Dr. Hake as to
whether he was a genuine child of

name="citation173"></a><a href="#footnote173"
class="citation">[173]</a>&nbsp; No one would cavil at that term
as applied to Whitman&mdash;yet one must not forget the
&ldquo;rainproof coat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In regarding the work of Whitman there are three aspects which
strike one especially.&nbsp; His attitude towards Art, towards
Humanity, towards Life.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>First of all, Whitman&rsquo;s attitude towards Art.</p>
<p>For the highest art two essentials are
required&mdash;Sincerity and Beauty.&nbsp; The tendency of modern
literature has been to ignore the first and to make the second
all-sufficient.&nbsp; The efforts of the artist have been
concentrated upon the workmanship, and too often he has been
satisfied with a merely technical excellence.</p>
<p>It is a pleasant and attractive pastime, this playing with
words.&nbsp; Grace, charm, and brilliance are within the reach of
the artificer&rsquo;s endeavour.&nbsp; But a literature which is
the outcome of the striving after beauty of form, without
reference to the sincerity of substance, is like a posy of
flowers torn away from their roots.&nbsp; Lacking vitality, it
will speedily perish.</p>
<p>No writer has seen this more clearly than Whitman, and if in
his vigorous allegiance to Sincerity he has seemed oblivious at
times to the existence of Beauty, yet he has chosen the better
part.&nbsp; And for this reason.&nbsp; Beauty will follow in the
wake of Sincerity, whether sought for or no, and the writer whose
one passion it is <!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>to see things as they are, and to
disentangle from the transient and fleeting the great truths of
life, finds that in achieving a noble sincerity he has also
achieved the highest beauty.</p>
<p>The great utterances of the world are beautiful, because they
are true.&nbsp; Whereas the artist who is determined to attain
beauty at all costs will obtain beauty of a
kind&mdash;&ldquo;silver-grey, placid and perfect,&rdquo; as
Andrea del Sarto said, but the highest beauty it will not be, for
that is no mere question of manner, but a perfect blend of manner
and matter.</p>
<p>It will no doubt be urged that, despite his sincerity, there
is a good deal in Whitman that is not beautiful.&nbsp; And this
must be frankly conceded.&nbsp; But this will be found only when
he has failed to separate the husk from the kernel.&nbsp;
Whitman&rsquo;s sincerity is never in question, but he does not
always appreciate the difference between accuracy and truth,
between the accidental and the essential.&nbsp; For instance,
lines like these&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The six framing men, two in the middle, and
two at each end, carefully bearing on their shoulders a heavy
stick for a cross-beam.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or physiological detail after this fashion:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mouth, tongue, lips, teeth, roof of the
mouth, jaws and the jaw hinges,<br />
Nose, nostrils of the nose, and the partition,<br />
Cheeks, temples, forehead, chin, throat, back of the neck
sheer.<br />
Strong shoulders, manly beard, hind shoulders, and the ample size
round of the chest,<br />
Upper arm, armpit, elbow socket, lower arms, arm sinews, arm
bones.<br />
Wrist and wrist joints, hand, palm, knuckles, thumb, forefinger,
finger joints, finger nails, etc., etc.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>The vital idea lying beneath these accumulated facts is
lost sight of by the reader who has to wade through so many
accurate non-essentials.</p>
<p>It is well, I think, to seize upon the weakness of
Whitman&rsquo;s literary style at the outset, for it explains so
much that is irritating and disconcerting.</p>
<p><i>Leaves of Grass</i> he called his book, and the name is
more significant than one at first realizes.&nbsp; For there is
about it not only the sweetness, the freshness, the luxuriance of
the grass; but its prolific rankness&mdash;the wheat and the
tares grow together.</p>
<p>It has, I know, been urged by some of Whitman&rsquo;s admirers
that his power as a writer does not depend upon his artistic
methods or non-artistic methods, and he himself protested against
his <i>Leaves</i> being judged merely as literature.&nbsp; And so
there has been a tendency to glorify his very inadequacies, to
hold him up as a poet who has defied successfully the unwritten
laws of Art.</p>
<p>This is to do him an ill service.&nbsp; If Whitman&rsquo;s
work be devoid of Art, then it possesses no durability.&nbsp;
Literature is an art just as much as music, painting, or
sculpture.&nbsp; And if a man, however fine, however inspiring
his ideas may be, has no power to shape them&mdash;to express
them in colour, in sound, in form, in words&mdash;to seize upon
the essentials and use no details save as suffice to illustrate
these essentials, then his work will not last.&nbsp; For it has
no vitality.</p>
<p>In other words, Whitman must be judged ultimately as an
artist, for Art alone endures.&nbsp; And on the whole he can
certainly bear the test.&nbsp; His art was not the conventional
art of his day, but art it assuredly was.</p>
<p><!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

beauty.</p>
<p>Who could deny the title of artist to the man who wrote those
noble verses, &ldquo;On the Beach at Night&rdquo;?&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On the beach at night,<br />
Stands a child with her father,<br />
Watching the east, the autumn sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up through the darkness,<br />
While ravening clouds, the burial clouds, in black masses
spreading,<br />
Lower sullen and fast athwart and down the sky,<br />
Amid a transparent clear belt of ether yet left in the east,<br
/>
Ascends large and calm the lord-star Jupiter,<br />
And nigh at hand, only a very little above,<br />
Swim the delicate sisters the Pleiades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the beach the child holding the hand of her
father,<br />
Those burial clouds that lower victorious soon to devour all<br
/>
Watching, silently weeps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weep not, child,<br />
Weep not, my darling,<br />
With these kisses let me remove your tears,<br />
The ravening clouds shall not long be victorious,<br />
They shall not long possess the sky, they devour the stars only
in apparition,<br />
Jupiter shall emerge, be patient, watch again another night, the
Pleiades shall emerge,<br />
They are immortal, all those stars both silvery and golden shall
shine out again,<br />
The great stars and the little ones shall shine out again, they
endure,<br />
The vast immortal suns and the long-enduring pensive moons shall
again shine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, dearest child, mournest thou only for Jupiter?<br
/>
Considerest thou alone the burial of the stars?</p>
<p><!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

(With my lips soothing thee, adding I whisper,<br />
I give thee the first suggestion, the problem and indirection)<br
/>
Something there is more immortal even than the stars,<br />
(Many the burials, many the days and nights, passing away)<br />
Something that shall endure longer even than lustrous Jupiter,<br
/>
Longer than sun or any revolving satellite,<br />
Or the radiant sisters the Pleiades.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or those touching lines,
&ldquo;Reconciliation&rdquo;?&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Word over all beautiful as the sky,<br />
Beautiful that war and all its deeds of carnage must in time be
utterly lost,<br />
That the hands of the sisters Death and Night incessantly<br />
Wash again, and ever again, this soil&rsquo;d world;<br />
For my enemy is dead, a man divine as myself is dead,<br />
I look where he lies white-faced and still in the
coffin&mdash;<br />
I draw near&mdash;<br />
Bend down and touch lightly with my lips the white face in the
coffin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again, take that splendid dirge in memory of President
Lincoln, majestic in its music, spacious and grand in its
treatment.&nbsp; It is too long for quotation, but the opening
lines, with their suggestive beauty, and the Song to Death, may
be instanced.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When lilacs last in the dooryard

<p><!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>This is not only Art, but great Art.&nbsp; So fresh in
their power, so striking in their beauty, are Whitman&rsquo;s
utterances on Death that they take their place in our memories
beside the large utterances of Shakespeare, Milton, and
Shelley.</p>
<p>It is a mistake to think that where Whitman fails in
expression it is through carelessness; that he was a great poet
by flashes, and that had he taken more pains he would have been
greater still.&nbsp; We have been assured by those who knew him
intimately that he took the greatest care over his work, and
would wait for days until he could get what he felt to be the
right word.</p>
<p>To the student who comes fresh to a study of Whitman it is
conceivable that the rude, strong, nonchalant utterances may seem
like the work of an inspired but careless and impatient
artist.&nbsp; It is not so.&nbsp; It is done deliberately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I furnish no specimens,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;I shower
them by exhaustless laws, fresh and modern continually, as Nature
does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He is content to be suggestive, to stir your imagination, to
awaken your sympathies.&nbsp; And when he fails, he fails as
Wordsworth did, because he lacked the power of self-criticism,
lacked the faculty of humour&mdash;that saving faculty which
gives discrimination, and intuitively protects the artist from
confusing pathos with bathos, the grand and the grandiose.&nbsp;
Nowhere is this more apparent than in his treatment of Sex.&nbsp;
Frankness, outspokenness on the primal facts of life are to be
welcomed in literature.&nbsp; All the great masters&mdash;<!--
page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>Shakespeare, Dante, Dostoievsky, Tolstoy, have dealt
openly and fearlessly with the elemental passions.&nbsp; There is
nothing to deplore in this, and Mr. Swinburne was quite right
when he contended that the domestic circle is not to be for all
men and writers the outer limit of their world of work.&nbsp; So
far from regretting that Whitman claimed right to equal freedom
when speaking of the primal fact of procreation as when speaking
of sunrise, sunsetting, and the primal fact of death, every
clean-minded man and woman should rejoice in the poet&rsquo;s
attitude.&nbsp; For he believed and gloried in the separate
personalities of man and woman, claiming manhood and womanhood as
the poet&rsquo;s province, exulting in the potentialities of a
healthy sexual life.&nbsp; He was angry, as well he might be,
with the furtive snigger which greets such matters as motherhood
and fatherhood with the prurient unwholesomeness of a mind that
can sigh sentimentally over the &ldquo;roses and raptures of
Vice&rdquo; and start away shamefaced from the stark
passions&mdash;stripped of all their circumlocutions.&nbsp; He
certainly realized as few have done the truth of that fine saying
of Thoreau&rsquo;s, that &ldquo;for him to whom sex is impure
there are no flowers in Nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at the same time I cannot help feeling that Stevenson was
right when he said that Whitman &ldquo;loses our sympathy in the
character of a poet by attracting too much of our
attention&mdash;that of a Bull in a China Shop.&rdquo; <a
name="citation180"></a><a href="#footnote180"
class="citation">[180]</a></p>
<p>His aim is right enough; it is to his method one may take
objection.&nbsp; Not on the score of morality.&nbsp;
Whitman&rsquo;s <!-- page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>treatment of passion is not immoral;
it is simply like Nature herself&mdash;unmoral.&nbsp; What shall
we say then about his sex cycle, &ldquo;Children of
Adam&rdquo;?&nbsp; Whitman, in his anxiety to speak out, freely,
simply, naturally, to vindicate the sanity of coarseness, the
poetry of animalism, seems to me to have bungled rather
badly.&nbsp; There are many fine passages in his &ldquo;Song of
the Body Electric&rdquo; and &ldquo;Spontaneous Me,&rdquo; but
much of it impresses me as bad art, and is consequently
ineffectual in its aim.&nbsp; The subject demands a treatment at
once strong and subtle&mdash;I do not mean finicking&mdash;and
subtlety is a quality not vouchsafed to Whitman.&nbsp; Lacking
it, he is often unconsciously comic where he should be gravely
impressive.&nbsp; &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s body is sacred, and a
woman&rsquo;s body is sacred.&rdquo;&nbsp; True; but the
sacredness is not displayed by making out a tedious inventory of
the various parts of the body.&nbsp; Says Whitman in effect:
&ldquo;The sexual life is to be gloried in, not to be treated as
if it were something shameful.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again true; but is
there not a danger of missing the glory by discoursing noisily on
the various physiological manifestations.&nbsp; Sex is not the
more wonderful for being appraised by the big drum.</p>
<p>The inherent beauty and sanctity of Sex lies surely in its
superb unconsciousness; it is a matter for two human beings drawn
towards one another by an indefinable, world-old attraction;
scream about it, caper over it, and you begin to make it
ridiculous, for you make it self-conscious.</p>
<p>Animalism merely as a scientific fact serves naught to the
poet, unless he can show also what is as undeniable <!-- page
182--><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>as
the bare fact&mdash;its poetry, its coarseness, and its mystery
go together.&nbsp; Browning has put it in a line:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;. . . savage creatures seek<br />
Their loves in wood and plain&mdash;<i>and </i><span
class="smcap"><i>God</i></span><i> renews</i><br />
<i>His ancient rapture</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the &ldquo;rapture&rdquo; and the mystery which Whitman
misses in many of his songs of Sex.</p>
<p>There is no need to give here any theological significance to
the word &ldquo;God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let the phrase stand for the
mystic poetry of animalism.&nbsp; Whitman has no sense of
mystery.</p>
<p>I have another objection against &ldquo;The Children of
Adam.&rdquo;&nbsp; The loud, self-assertive, genial, boastful
style of Whitman suits very well many of his democratic
utterances, his sweeping cosmic emotions.&nbsp; But here it gives
one the impression of a kind of showman, who with a flourishing
stick is shouting out to a gaping crowd the excellences of
manhood and womanhood.&nbsp; Deliberately he has refrained from
the mood of imaginative fervour which alone could give a high
seriousness to his treatment&mdash;a high seriousness which is
really indispensable.&nbsp; And his rough, slangy, matter-of-fact
comments give an atmosphere of unworthy vulgarity to his
subject.&nbsp; Occasionally he is carried away by the sheer
imaginative beauty of the subject, then note how different the
effect:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Have you ever loved the body of a woman,<br
/>
Have you ever loved the body of a man,<br />
Do you not see that these are exactly the same to all in all<br
/>
Nations and times all over the earth?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>&ldquo;If anything is sacred, the human body is
sacred,<br />
And the glory and sweet of a man is the token of manhood
untainted,<br />
And in man or woman a clean, strong, firm-fibred body is<br />
More beautiful than the most beautiful face.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If only all had been of this quality.&nbsp; But interspersed
with lines of great force and beauty are cumbrous irrelevancies,
wholly superfluous details.</p>
<p>William Morris has also treated the subject of Sex in a frank,
open fashion.&nbsp; And there is in his work something of the
easy, deliberate spaciousness that we find in Whitman.&nbsp; But
Morris was an artist first and foremost, and he never misses the
<i>poetry</i> of animalism; as readers of the &ldquo;Earthly
Paradise&rdquo; and the prose romances especially know full
well.</p>
<p>It is not then because Whitman treats love as an animal
passion that I take objection to much in his &ldquo;Children of
Adam.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are poets enough and to spare who sing
of the sentimental aspects of love.&nbsp; We need have no quarrel
with Whitman&rsquo;s aim as expressed by Mr. John Burroughs:
&ldquo;To put in his sex poems a rank and healthy animality, and
to make them as frank as the shedding of pollen by the trees,
strong even to the point of offence.&rdquo;&nbsp; All we ask is
for him to do so as a poet, not as a mere physiologist.&nbsp; And
when he speaks one moment as a physiologist, next as a poet; at
one time as a lover, at another as a showman, the result is not
inspiring.&nbsp; &ldquo;He could not make it pleasing,&rdquo;
remarks Mr. Burroughs, &ldquo;a sweet morsel to be rolled under
the tongue; that would have been levity and sin, as in Byron and
the other poets . . .&nbsp; He would sooner be <!-- page 184--><a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>bestial
than Byronic, he would sooner shock by his frankness than inflame
by his suggestion.&rdquo;&nbsp; This vague linking together of
&ldquo;Byron and the other poets&rdquo; is not easy to
understand.&nbsp; In the first place, not one of the moderns has
treated love from the same standpoint.&nbsp; Shelley, for
instance, is transcendental, Byron elemental, Tennyson
sentimental; Rossetti looks at the soul through the body,
Browning regards the body through the soul.&nbsp; There is
abundant variety in the treatment.&nbsp; Then, again, why Byron
should be singled out especially for opprobrium I fail to see,
for love is to him the fierce elemental passion it is for
Whitman.&nbsp; As for frankness, the episode of Haidee and Don
Juan does not err on the side of reticence.&nbsp; Nor is it
pruriently suggestive.&nbsp; It is a splendid piece of poetic
animalism.&nbsp; Let us be fair to Byron.&nbsp; His work may in
places be disfigured by an unworthy cynicism; his treatment of
sexual problems be marred by a shallow flippancy.&nbsp; But no
poet had a finer appreciation of the essential poetry of
animalism than he, and much of his cynicism, after all, is by way
of protest against the same narrow morality at which Whitman
girds.&nbsp; To single Byron out as a poet especially obnoxious
in his treatment of love, and to condemn him so sweepingly, seems
to me scarcely defensible.&nbsp; To extol unreservedly the
rankness and coarseness of &ldquo;The Children of Adam,&rdquo;
and to have no word of commendation, say, for so noble a piece of
naturalism as the story of Haidee, seems to me lacking in
fairness.&nbsp; Besides, it suggests that the <i>only</i>
treatment in literature of the sexual life is a coarse,
unpleasing treatment, which I do not suppose Mr. Burroughs <!--
page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>really holds.&nbsp; Whitman has vindicated, and
vindicated finely, the inherent truth and beauty of
animalism.&nbsp; But so has William Morris, so has Dante Gabriel
Rossetti, so has poor flouted Byron.&nbsp; And I will go further,
and say that these other poets have succeeded often where Whitman
has failed; they have shown the beauty and cosmic significance,
when Whitman has been merely cataloguing the stark facts.</p>
<p>It may be objected, of course, that Whitman does not aim in
his sex poems at imaginative beauty, that he aims at sanity and
wholesomeness; that what he speaks&mdash;however rank&mdash;makes
for healthy living.&nbsp; May be; I am not concerned to deny
it.&nbsp; What I do deny is the implication that the
wholesomeness of a fact is sufficient justification for its
treatment in literature.&nbsp; There are a good many disagreeable
things that are wholesome enough, there are many functions of the
body that are entirely healthy.&nbsp; But one does not want them
enshrined in Art.</p>
<p>To attack Whitman on the score of morality is unjustifiable;
his sex poems are simply unmoral.&nbsp; But had he flouted his
art less flagrantly in them they would have been infinitely more
powerful and convincing, and given the Philistines less
opportunity for blaspheming.</p>
<p>I have dwelt at this length upon Whitman&rsquo;s treatment of
Sex largely because it illustrates his strength and weakness as a
literary artist.&nbsp; In some of his poems&mdash;those dealing
with Democracy, for instance&mdash;we have Whitman at his
best.&nbsp; In others, certainly a small proportion, we get
sheer, unillumined doggerel.&nbsp; In his sex poems there are
great and fine ideas, moments of inspiration, <!-- page 186--><a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>flashes of
beauty, combined with much that is trivial and tiresome.</p>
<p>But this I think is the inevitable outcome of his style.&nbsp;
The style, like the man, is large, broad, sweeping, tolerant; the
sense of &ldquo;mass and multitude&rdquo; is remarkable; he aims
at big effects, and the quality of vastness in his writings
struck John Addington Symonds as his most remarkable
characteristic. <a name="citation186"></a><a href="#footnote186"
class="citation">[186]</a>&nbsp; This vast, rolling, processional
style is splendidly adapted for dealing with the elemental
aspects of life, with the vital problems of humanity.&nbsp; He
sees everything in bulk.&nbsp; His range of vision is
cosmic.&nbsp; The very titles are suggestive of his point of
view&mdash;&ldquo;A Song of the Rolling Earth,&rdquo; &ldquo;A
Song of the Open Road,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Song for
Occupation,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gods.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are no
detailed effects, no delicate points of light and shade in his
writings, but huge panoramic effects.&nbsp; It is a great style,
it is an impressive style, but it is obviously not a plastic
style, nor a versatile style.&nbsp; Its very merits necessarily
carry with them corresponding defects.&nbsp; The massiveness
sometimes proves mere unwieldiness, the virile strength tends to
coarseness, the eye fixed on certain broad distant effects misses
the delicate by-play of colour and movement in the
foreground.&nbsp; The persistent unconventionality of metre and
rhythm becomes in time a mannerism as pronounced as the mannerism
of Tennyson and Swinburne.</p>
<p>I do not urge these things in disparagement of Whitman.&nbsp;
No man can take up a certain line wholeheartedly and
uncompromisingly without incurring the disabilities attaching to
all who concentrate on one great issue.</p>
<p><!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>And if sometimes he is ineffectual, if on occasion he
is merely strident in place of authoritative, how often do his
utterances carry with them a superb force and a conviction which
compel us to recognize the sagacious genius of the man.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>Indeed, it is when we examine Whitman&rsquo;s attitude towards
Humanity that we realize best his strength and courage.&nbsp; For
it is here that his qualities find their fittest artistic
expression.&nbsp; Nothing in Whitman&rsquo;s view is common or
unclean.&nbsp; All things in the Universe, rightly considered,
are sweet and good.&nbsp; Carrying this view into social
politics, Whitman declares for absolute social equality.&nbsp;
And this is done in no doctrinaire spirit, but because of
Whitman&rsquo;s absolute faith and trust in man and
woman&mdash;not the man and woman overridden by the artifices of
convention, but the &ldquo;powerful uneducated
person.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whitman finds his ideal not in Society (with
a capital S), but in artisans and mechanics.&nbsp; He took to his
heart the mean, the vulgar, the coarse, not idealizing their
weaknesses, but imbuing them with his own strength and
vigour.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am enamoured of growth out of doors,<br
/>
Of men that live among cattle, or taste of the ocean or woods,<br
/>
Of the builder and steerers of ships, and the wielders of axes,
and<br />
The drivers of horses.<br />
I can eat and sleep with them week in week out.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>Such are his comrades.&nbsp; And well he knows
them.&nbsp; For many years of his life he was roving through
country and city, coming into daily contact with the men and
women about whom he has sung.&nbsp; Walt Whitman&mdash;farm boy,
school teacher, printer, editor, traveller, mechanic, nurse in
the army hospital, Government clerk.&nbsp; Truly our poet has
graduated as few have done in the school of Life.&nbsp; No writer
of our age has better claims to be considered the Poet of
Democracy.</p>
<p>But he was no sentimentalist.&nbsp; More tolerant and passive
in disposition than Victor Hugo, he had the same far-seeing
vision when dealing with the people.&nbsp; He recognized their
capacity for good, their unconquerable faith, their aspirations,
their fine instincts; but he recognized also their brutality and
fierceness.&nbsp; He would have agreed with Spencer&rsquo;s
significant words: &ldquo;There is no alchemy by which you can
get golden conduct out of leaden instincts&rdquo;; but he would
have denied Spencer&rsquo;s implication that leaden instincts
ruled the Democracy.&nbsp; And he was right.&nbsp; There is more
real knowledge of men and women in <i>Leaves of Grass</i> and
<i>Les Miserables</i> than in all the volumes of the Synthetic
Philosophy.&nbsp; Thus Whitman announces his theme:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Of Life immense in passion, pulse, and
power,<br />
Cheerful, for freest action formed under the laws divine.<br />
The modern man I sing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Whitman,&rdquo; wrote the late Mr. William Clarke, in
his stimulating study of the Poet, <a name="citation188"></a><a
href="#footnote188" class="citation">[188]</a> &ldquo;sings of
the Modern Man as workman, friend, citizen, brother, comrade, as
pioneer of a new social order, as both material and <!-- page
189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>spiritual, final and most subtle, compound of spirit
and nature, firmly planted on this rolling earth, and yet
&lsquo;moving about in worlds not realized.&rsquo;&nbsp; As
representative democratic bard Whitman exhibits complete freedom
from unconventionality, a very deep human love for all, faith in
the rationality of the world, courage, energy, and the instincts
of solidarity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the introductory essay to this volume some remarks were
made about the affections of the literary Vagabond in general and
of Whitman in particular, which call now for an ampler treatment,
especially as on this point I find myself, apparently, at issue
with so many able and discerning critics of Whitman.&nbsp; I say
apparently because a consideration of the subject may show that
the difference, though real, is not so fundamental as it appears
to be.</p>
<p>That Whitman entertained a genuine affection for men and women
is, of course, too obvious to be gainsaid.&nbsp; His noble work
in the hospitals, his tenderness towards criminals and
outcasts&mdash;made known to us through the testimony of
friends&mdash;show him to be a man of comprehensive
sympathies.&nbsp; No man of a chill and calculating nature could
have written as he did, and, although his writings are not free
of affectation, the strenuous, fundamental sincerity of the man
impresses every line.</p>
<p>But was it, to quote William Clarke, &ldquo;a <i>very deep</i>
human love&rdquo;?&nbsp; This seems to me a point of
psychological interest.&nbsp; A man may exhibit kindliness and
tenderness towards his fellow-creatures without showing any deep
personal attachment.&nbsp; In fact, the wider a <!-- page
190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>man&rsquo;s sympathies are the less room is there for
any strong individual feeling.&nbsp; His friend, Mr. Donaldson,
has told us that he never remembers Whitman shedding a tear of
grief over the death of any friend.&nbsp; Tears of joy he shed
often; but no tear of sorrow, of personal regret.&nbsp; It is
true that Mr. Donaldson draws no particular inference from this
fact.&nbsp; It seems to me highly significant.&nbsp; The absence
of intense emotion is no argument truly for insensibility; but to
a man of large, sweeping sympathies such as Whitman the loss of a
particular friend did not strike home as it would do in men of
subtler temperaments.</p>
<p>Cosmic emotions leave no room for those special manifestations
of concentrated feeling in individual instances which men with a
narrower range of sympathies frequently show.</p>
<p>For in denying that Whitman was a man capable of &ldquo;a very
deep human love,&rdquo; no moral censure is implied.&nbsp; If not
deep, it was certainly comprehensive; and rarely, if ever, do the
two qualities coexist.&nbsp; Depth of feeling is not to be found
in men of the tolerant, passive type; it is the intolerant,
comparatively narrow-minded man who loves deeply; the man of few
friends, not the man who takes the whole human race to his heart
in one colossal embrace.&nbsp; Narrowness may exist, of course,
without intensity.&nbsp; But intensity of temperament always
carries with it a certain forceful narrowness.&nbsp; Such a man,
strongly idiosyncratic, with his sympathies running in a special
groove, is capable of one or two affections that absorb his
entire nature.&nbsp; Those whom he cares for are so subtly bound
up with <!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>the peculiarities of his temperament
that they become a part of his very life.&nbsp; And if they go,
so interwoven are their personalities with the fibres of his
being, that part of his life goes with them.&nbsp; To such the
death of an intimate friend is a blow that shatters them beyond
recovery.&nbsp; Courage and endurance, indeed, they may show, and
the undiscerning may never note how fell the blow has been.&nbsp;
But though the healing finger of Time will assuage the wound, the
scars they will carry to their dying day.</p>
<p>As a rule, such men, lovable as they may be to the few, are
not of the stuff of which social reformers are made.&nbsp; They
feel too keenly, too sensitively, are guided too much by
individual temperamental preferences.&nbsp; It is of no use for
any man who has to deal with coarse-grained humanity, with all
sorts and conditions of men, to be fastidious in his
tastes.&nbsp; A certain bluntness, a certain rude hardiness, a
certain evenness of disposition is absolutely necessary.&nbsp; We
are told of Whitman by one of his most ardent admirers that his
life was &ldquo;a pleased, uninterested saunter through the
world&mdash;no hurry, no fever, no strife, hence no bitterness,
no depression, no wasted energies . . . in all his tastes and
attractions always aiming to live thoroughly in the free
nonchalant spirit of the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes; this is the type of man wanted as a social pioneer, as a
poet of the people.&nbsp; A man who felt more acutely, for whom
the world was far too terrible a place for sauntering, would be
quite unfitted for Whitman&rsquo;s task.&nbsp; It was essential
that he should have lacked deep individual affection.&nbsp;
Something had to be sacrificed <!-- page 192--><a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>for the
work he had before him, and we need not lament that he had no
predilection for those intimate personal ties that mean so much
to some.</p>
<p>A man who has to speak a word of cheer to so many can ill
afford to linger with the few.&nbsp; He is not even concerned to
convert you to his way of thinking.&nbsp; He throws out a hint, a
suggestion, the rest you must do for yourself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a man who, sauntering along without fully
stopping, turns a casual look upon you, and then averts his
face.&nbsp; Leaving you to prove and define it.&nbsp; Expecting
the main things from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nowhere are Whitman&rsquo;s qualities more admirably shown
than in his attitude towards the average human being.&nbsp; As a
rule the ordinary man is not a person whom the Poet delights to
honour.&nbsp; He is concerned with the exceptional, the
extraordinary type.&nbsp; Whitman&rsquo;s attitude then is of
special interest.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I will leave all and come and make the
hymns of you;<br />
None has understood you, but I understand you;<br />
None has done justice to you&mdash;you have not done justice to
yourself.<br />
None but has found you imperfect; I only find no imperfection in
you.<br />
None but would subordinate you; I only am he who will never
consent to subordinate you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Painters have painted their swarming groups, and the
centre figure of all;<br />
From the head of the centre figure, spreading a nimbus of

But I paint myriads of heads, but paint no head without its
nimbus of gold-coloured light.<br />
<!-- page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

streams effulgently flowing for ever.<br />
O! I could sing such grandeurs and glories about you!<br />
You have not known what you are; you have slumbered upon yourself
all your time.&nbsp; . . .&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so on, in a vein of courageous cheer, spoken with the big,
obtrusive, genial egotism that always meets us in Whitman&rsquo;s
writings.&nbsp; Whitman&rsquo;s egotism proves very exasperating
to some readers, but I do not think it should trouble us
much.&nbsp; After all it is the egotism of a simple, natural,
sincere nature; there is no self-satisfied smirk about it, no
arrogance.&nbsp; He is conscious of his powers, and is quite
frank in letting you know this.&nbsp; Perhaps his boisterous
delight in his own prowess may jar occasionally on the nerves;
but how much better than the affected humility of some
writers.&nbsp; And the more you study his writings the less does
this egotism affect even the susceptible.&nbsp; Your ears get
attuned to the pitch of the voice, you realize that the big drum
is beaten with a purpose.&nbsp; For it must be remembered that it
is an egotism entirely emptied of condescension.&nbsp; He is vain
certainly, but mainly because he glories in the common heritage,
because he feels he is one of the common people.&nbsp; He is
proud assuredly, but it is pride that exults in traits that he
shares in common with the artist, the soldier, and the
sailor.&nbsp; He is no writer who plays down to the masses, who
will prophesy fair things&mdash;like the mere demagogue&mdash;in
order to win their favour.&nbsp; And it is a proof of his plain
speaking, of his fearless candour, that for the most part the
very men for whom he wrote care little for him.</p>
<p><!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>Conventionality rules every class in the
community.&nbsp; Whitman&rsquo;s gospel of social equality is not
altogether welcome to the average man.&nbsp; One remembers Mr.
Barrie&rsquo;s pleasant satire of social distinction in <i>The
Admirable Crichton</i>, where the butler resents his radical
master&rsquo;s suggestion that no real difference separates
employer and employed.&nbsp; He thinks it quite in keeping with
the eternal fitness of things that his master should assert the
prerogative of &ldquo;Upper Dog,&rdquo; and points out how that
there are many social grades below stairs, and that an elaborate
hierarchy separates the butler at one end from the &ldquo;odds
and ends&rdquo; at the other.</p>
<p>In like manner the ordinary citizen resents Whitman&rsquo;s
genuine democratic spirit, greatly preferring the sentimental
Whiggism of Tennyson.</p>
<p>Whitman reminds us by his treatment of the vulgar, the
ordinary, the commonplace, that he signalizes a new departure in
literature.&nbsp; Of poets about the people there have been many,
but he is the first genuine Poet <i>of</i> the People.</p>
<p>Art is in its essence aristocratic, it strives after
selectness, eschews the trivial and the trite.&nbsp; There is,
therefore, in literature always a tendency towards conservatism;
the literary artist grows more and more fastidious in his choice
of words; the cheap and vulgar must be rigorously excluded, and
only those words carrying with them stately and beautiful
associations are to be countenanced.&nbsp; Thus Classicism in Art
constantly needs the freshening, broadening influence of
Romanticism.</p>
<p><!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>What Conservatism and Liberalism are to Politics
Classicism and Romanticism are to Art.&nbsp; Romantic revolutions
have swept over literature before the nineteenth century, and
Shakespeare was the first of our great Romantics.&nbsp; Then with
the reaction Formalism and Conservatism crept in again.&nbsp; But
the Romantic Revival at the beginning of the nineteenth century
went much further than previous ones.&nbsp; Out of the throes of
the Industrial Revolution had been born a lusty, clamorous infant
that demanded recognition&mdash;the new Demos.&nbsp; And it
claimed not only recognition in politics, but recognition in
literature.&nbsp; Wordsworth and Shelley essayed to speak for it
with varying success; but Wordsworth was too exclusive, and
Shelley&mdash;the most sympathetic of all our poets till the
coming of Browning&mdash;was too ethereal in his manner.&nbsp;
Like his own skylark, he sang to us poised midway between earth
and heaven; a more emphatically flesh and blood personage was
wanted.</p>
<p>Here and there a writer of genuine democratic feeling, like
Ebenezer Elliott, voiced the aspirations of the people, but only
on one side.&nbsp; Thomas Hood and Mrs. Browning sounded a deeper
note; but the huge, clamorous populace needed a yet fuller note,
a more penetrating insight, a more forceful utterance.&nbsp; And
in America, with its seething democracy&mdash;a democracy more
urgent, more insistent than our own&mdash;it found its
spokesman.&nbsp; That it did not recognize him, and is only just
beginning to do so, is not remarkable.&nbsp; It did not recognize
him, for it had scarcely recognized itself.&nbsp; Only dimly did
it realize its wants <!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>and aspirations.&nbsp; Whitman
divined them; he is the Demos made articulate.</p>
<p>And not only did he sweep away the Conservative traditions and
conventions of literature, he endeavoured to overthrow the
aristocratic principle that underlies it.&nbsp; Selectness he
would replace with simplicity.&nbsp; No doubt he went too
far.&nbsp; That is of small moment.&nbsp; Exaggeration and
over-emphasis have their place in the scheme of things.&nbsp; A
thunderstorm may be wanted to clear the air, and if it does
incidentally some slight damage to crops and trees it is of no
use grumbling.</p>
<p>But in the main Whitman&rsquo;s theory of Art was very true
and finely suggestive, and is certainly not the view of a man who
cares for nothing but the wild and barbaric.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The art of Art, the glory of expression,
and the sunshine of the light of letters is simplicity.&nbsp;
Nothing is better than simplicity, nothing can make up for excess
or for the lack of definiteness.&nbsp; To carry on the heave of
impulse, and pierce intellectual depths, and give all subjects
their articulations, are powers neither common nor very
uncommon.&nbsp; But to speak in literature with the perfect
rectitude and insouciance of the movements of animals and the
unimpeachableness of the sentiment of trees in the woods, and
grass by the woodside, is the flawless triumph of Art.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A fitting attitude for a Poet of Democracy, one likely to
bring him into direct contact with the broad, variegated stream
of human life.</p>
<p>What perhaps he did not realize so clearly is that Nature, no
less than Art, exercises the selective facility, <!-- page
197--><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>and corrects her own riotous extravagance.&nbsp; And
thus on occasion he falls into the very indefiniteness, the very
excess he deprecates.</p>
<p>The way in which his Art and democratic spirit correspond
suggests another, though less unconventional poet of the
Democracy&mdash;William Morris.&nbsp; The spaciousness the
directness, the tolerance that characterise Whitman&rsquo;s work
are to be found to Morris.&nbsp; Morris had no eclectic
preferences either in Art or Nature.&nbsp; A wall paper, a
tapestry, an epic were equally agreeable tasks; and a blade of
grass delighted him as fully as a sunset.&nbsp; So with
men.&nbsp; He loved many, but no one especially.&nbsp;
Catholicity rather than intensity characterised his
friendships.&nbsp; And, like Whitman, he could get on cheerfully
enough with surprisingly unpleasant people, provided they were
working for the cause in which he was interested. <a
name="citation197"></a><a href="#footnote197"
class="citation">[197]</a>&nbsp; That is the secret.&nbsp;
Whitman and Morris loved the Cause.&nbsp; They looked at things
in the mass, at people in the mass.&nbsp; This is the true
democratic spirit.&nbsp; They had no time, nor must it be
confessed any special interest&mdash;in the individual as
such.&nbsp; What I have said about Whitman&rsquo;s affection
being comprehensive rather than intense applies equally to
Morris.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because it is the way of the Democrat
and the Social Reformer.&nbsp; To such the individual suggests a
whole class, a class suggests the race.&nbsp; Whitman is always
speaking to man as man, rarely does he touch on individual
men.&nbsp; If he does so, it is only to pass on to some cosmic
thoughts suggested by the particular instance.</p>
<p><!-- page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>Perhaps the most inspiring thing about Whitman&rsquo;s
attitude towards humanity is his thorough understanding of the
working classes, and his quick discernment of the healthy
naturalism that animates them.&nbsp; He neither patronizes them
nor idealizes them; he sees their faults, which are obvious
enough; but he also sees, what is not so obvious, their fine
independence of spirit, their eager thirst for improvement, for
ampler knowledge, for larger opportunities, and their latent
idealism.</p>
<p>No doubt there is more independence, greater vigour, less
servility, in America than in England; but the men he especially
delights in, the artisan or mechanic, represent the best of the
working classes in either country.</p>
<p>In this respect Whitman and Tolstoy, differing in so many
ways, join hands.&nbsp; In the &ldquo;powerful uneducated
person&rdquo; they see the salvation of society, the renovation
of its an&aelig;mic life.</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>Whitman is no moralist, and has no formal philosophy to
offer.&nbsp; But the modern spirit which always seeks after some
&ldquo;criticism of life&rdquo; does not forsake even the
Vagabond.&nbsp; He is certainly the only Vagabond, with the
exception of Thoreau, who has felt himself charged with a message
for his fellows.&nbsp; The popular tendency is to look for a
&ldquo;message&rdquo; in all literary artists, and the result is
that the art in question is <!-- page 199--><a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>knocked
sometimes out of all shape in order to wrest from it some creed
or ethical teaching.&nbsp; And as the particular message usually
happens to be something that especially appeals to the seeker,
the number of conflicting messages wrung from the unfortunate
literary artist are somewhat disconcerting.</p>
<p>But in Whitman&rsquo;s case the task of the message hunter is
quite simple.&nbsp; Whitman never leaves us in doubt what he
believes in, and what ideas he wishes to propagate.&nbsp; It is
of course easy&mdash;perhaps inevitable&mdash;that with a writer
whose method it is to hint, suggest, indicate, rather than
formulate, elaborate, codify, the student should read in more
than was intended.&nbsp; And, after all, as George Eliot said,
&ldquo;The words of Genius bear a wider meaning than the thought
which prompted them.&rdquo;&nbsp; But at any rate there is no
mistaking the general outline of his thought, for his outlook
upon life is as distinctive as Browning&rsquo;s, and indeed
possesses many points of similarity.&nbsp; But in speaking of
Whitman&rsquo;s message one thing must be borne in mind.&nbsp;
Whitman&rsquo;s work must not be adjudged merely as a special
blend of Altruism and Individualism.&nbsp; No man ever works, it
has been well said <a name="citation199"></a><a
href="#footnote199" class="citation">[199]</a>&mdash;not even if
philanthropy be his trade&mdash;from the primary impulse to help
or console other people, any more than his body performs its
functions for the sake of other people.&nbsp; And what Professor
Nettleship says of Browning might be applied with equal truth to
Whitman.&nbsp; His work consists &ldquo;not in his being a
teacher, or even wanting to be one, but in his doing exactly the
work he liked best and could <!-- page 200--><a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>not help
doing.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Whitman&rsquo;s stimulating thought is
not the less true for that, for it is the spontaneous expression
of his personality, just as fully as a melody or picture is an
expression of an artist&rsquo;s personality.&nbsp; He could no
more help being a teacher than he could help breathing.&nbsp; And
his teaching must be valued not in accordance with the philosophy
of the schools, not by comparison with the ethics of the
professional moralist, but as the natural and inevitable outcome
of his personality and temperament.</p>
<p>As a panacea for social evils Whitman believes in the remedial
power of comradeship in a large-hearted charity.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You felons on trial in courts,<br />
You convicts in prison cells, you sentenced assassins chained and
handcuffed with iron,<br />
Who am I, too, that I am not on trial or in prison?<br />
Me ruthless and devilish as any, that my wrists are not
chained<br />
With iron, or my ankles with iron?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mark the watchful impassiveness with which he gazes at the
ugly side of life.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I sit and look out upon all the sorrows of
the world, and upon all oppression and shame;<br />
I hear convulsive sobs from young men at anguish with themselves,
remorseful after deeds done;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>I see the workings of battle, pestilence, tyranny;<br />
I see martyrs and prisoners&mdash;<br />
I observe a famine at sea&mdash;I observe the sailors casting
lots who shall be killed, to preserve the lives of the rest;<br
/>
I observe the slights and degradations cast by arrogant persons
upon labourers, the poor, and upon negroes and the like;<br />
All these&mdash;all the meanness and agony without end, I sit and
look out upon,<br />
See, hear, and am silent.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>No one is too base, too degraded for Whitman&rsquo;s
affection.&nbsp; This is no mere book sentiment with him; and
many stories are told of his tenderness and charity towards the
&ldquo;dregs of humanity.&rdquo;&nbsp; That a man is a human
being is enough for Whitman.&nbsp; However he may have fallen
there is something in him to appeal to.&nbsp; He would have
agreed with Browning that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Beneath the veriest ash there hides a spark
of soul,<br />
Which, quickened by Love&rsquo;s breath, may yet pervade the
whole<br />
O&rsquo; the grey, and free again be fire; of worth the same<br
/>
Howe&rsquo;er produced, for great or little flame is
flame.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like Browning, also, Whitman fears lassitude and indifference
more than the turmoil of passion.&nbsp; He glories in the
elemental.&nbsp; At present he thinks we are too fearful of
coarseness and rankness, lay too much stress on refinement.&nbsp;
And so he delights in &ldquo;unrefinement,&rdquo; glories in the
woods, air-sweetness, sun-tan, brawn.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>So long</i>!<br />
I announce a life that shall be copious, vehement, spiritual
bold,<br />
And I announce an did age that shall lightly and joyfully meet
its translation.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cultured conventions, of which we make so much, distress
him.&nbsp; They tend, he argues, to enervation, to a poor
imitative, self-conscious art, to an artificial, morbid life.</p>
<p>His curative methods were heroic; but who can say that they
were not needed, or that they were mischievous?</p>
<p>Certainly in aiming first of all at sincerity he has attained
that noble beauty which is born of strength.&nbsp; <!-- page
202--><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>Nature, as he saw, was full of vital loveliness by
reason of her very power.&nbsp; The average literary artist is
always seeking for the loveliness, aiming after beauty of form,
without a care whether what he is saying has the ring of
sincerity and truth, whether it is in touch with the realities of
Nature.&nbsp; And in his super-refinements he misses the beauty
that flashes forth from the rough, savage songs of Whitman.</p>
<p>Whitman does not decry culture.&nbsp; But he places first the
educative influence of Nature.&nbsp; &ldquo;The best
Culture,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;will always be that of the manly
and courageous instincts and loving perception, and of
self-respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No advocate of lawlessness he; the influence of modern
sciences informs every line that he has written.</p>
<p>As Mr. Burroughs very justly says: &ldquo;Whitman&rsquo;s
relation to science is fundamental and vital.&nbsp; It is the
soil under his feet.&nbsp; He comes into a world from which all
childish fear and illusion has been expelled.&nbsp; He exhibits
the religious and poetic faculties perfectly adjusted to a
scientific, industrial, democratic age, and exhibits them more
fervent and buoyant than ever before.&nbsp; We have gained more
than we have lost.&nbsp; The world is anew created by science and
democracy, and he pronounces it good with the joy and fervour of
the old faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this respect Mr. Burroughs thinks that Whitman shared with
Tennyson the glory of being one of the two poets in our time who
have drawn inspiration from this source.&nbsp; Certainly no poet
of our time has made finer use as an artist of scientific facts
than the late Laureate.</p>
<p>But Tennyson seems scarcely to have drawn inspiration <!--
page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>from science as did Browning, if we look at the thought
underlying the verse.&nbsp; On the whole scientific discoveries
depressed rather than cheered him, whereas from <i>Paracelsus</i>
onwards Browning accepts courageously all the results of modern
science, and, as in the case of Whitman, it enlarged his moral
and spiritual horizon.</p>
<p>But he was not a philosopher as Browning was; indeed, there is
less of the philosopher about Whitman than about any poet of our
age.&nbsp; His method is quite opposed to the philosophic.&nbsp;
It is instinctive, suggestive, and as full of contradictions as
Nature herself.&nbsp; You can no more extract a philosophy from
his sweeping utterances than you can from a tramp over the
hills.</p>
<p>But, like a tramp over the hills, Whitman fits every reader
who accompanies him for a stronger and more courageous
outlook.&nbsp; It is not easy to say with Whitman as in the case
of many writers: &ldquo;This line quickened my imagination, that
passage unravelled my perplexities.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is the
general effect of his writings that exercises such a remarkable
tonic influence.&nbsp; Perhaps he has never indicated this
cumulative power more happily than in the lines that conclude his
&ldquo;Song of Myself.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You will hardly know who I am, or what I
mean,<br />
But I shall be good health to you nevertheless,<br />
And filter and fibre your blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged.<br />
Missing me one place search another,<br />
I stop somewhere waiting for you.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes; that is Whitman&rsquo;s secret&mdash;&ldquo;Good
health.&rdquo;&nbsp; To speak of him as did his biographer, Dr.
Bucke, as &ldquo;perhaps the most advanced nature the world has
yet <!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>produced,&rdquo; to rank him, as
some have done, with the world&rsquo;s greatest moral teachers,
beside Jesus and Socrates, seems to me the language of hysterical
extravagant.&nbsp; Nay, more, it misses surely the special
significant of his genius.</p>
<p>In his religious thought, his artistic feelings, his
affections, there is breadth of sympathy, sanity of outlook, but
an entire absence of intensity, of depth.</p>
<p>We shall scan his pages vainly for the profound aspiration,
the subtle spiritual insight of our greatest religious
teachers.&nbsp; In his indifference to form, his insensibility to
the noblest music, we shall realize his artistic limitations.</p>
<p>Despite his genial comradeship, the more intimate, the more
delicate experiences of friendship are not to be found in his
company.&nbsp; Delicacy, light and shade, subtlety, intensity,
for these qualities you must not seek Whitman.&nbsp; But that is
no reason for neglecting him.&nbsp; The Modern and Ancient world
are rich in these other qualities, and the special need of the
present day is not intensity so much as sanity, not subtlety so
much as breadth.</p>
<p>In one of his clever phrases Mr. Havelock Ellis has described
Whitman &ldquo;as a kind of Titanic Undine.&rdquo; <a
name="citation204"></a><a href="#footnote204"
class="citation">[204]</a>&nbsp; Perhaps it is a good thing for
us that he never &ldquo;found his soul.&rdquo;&nbsp; In an age of
morbid self-introspection there is something refreshing in an
utterance like this, where he praises the animals
because&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They do not screech and whine about their
condition,<br />
They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,<br />
They do not make me sick discussing their duty to <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>In a feverish, restless age it is well to feel the
presence of that large, passive, tolerant figure.&nbsp; There is
healing in the cool, firm touch of his hand; healing in the
careless, easy self-confidence of his utterance.&nbsp; He has
spoken to us of &ldquo;the amplitude of the earth, and the
coarseness and sexuality of the earth, and the great charity of
the earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he has done this with the rough
outspokenness of the elements, with the splendid audacity of
Nature herself.&nbsp; Brawn, sun-tan, air-sweetness are things
well worth the having, for they mean good health.&nbsp; That is
why we welcome the big, genial sanity of Walt Whitman, for he has
about him the rankness and sweetness of the Earth.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
